            <text xml:space="preserve">{{Anarchism}}

'''Anarchism''' is the name of a [[political philosophy]] or a group of doctrines and attitudes that are centered on rejection of any form of compulsory [[government]] (such as the [[state]])&lt;ref&gt;Some differentiate government from state: &quot;A distinction that is relevant to the anarchist ideal is the difference between ''the government'', referring to the state, and ''government'', referring to the administration of a political system. Anarchists, like everyone, tend to use the word government as a synonym for state, but what is rejected by anarchism's ''a priori'' opposition to the state is not the concept of government as such but the idea of a sovereign order that claims and demand obedience, and if necessary the lives, of its subjects. Anarchism rejects the form of imposed, centralized authority enshrined and made material in the state.&quot; -Sheehan, Sean. Anarchism,  Reaktion Books 2004, p. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; and support its elimination.&lt;ref name=definitions&gt;
*''Anarchism''. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2006. Encyclop{{IPA|æ}}dia Britannica Premium Service. [[29 August]] [[2006]]  &lt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9117285&gt;. Anarchism is &quot;a cluster of doctrines and attitudes centred on the belief that government is both harmful and unnecessary.&quot;
*''Anarchism''. The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy. 2005. P. 14 &quot;Anarchism is the view that a society without the state, or government, is both possible and desirable.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;anarchism&quot; is [[etymology|derived from]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Wiktionary:αναρχία|αναρχία]]'' (&quot;without [[archon]]s&quot; or &quot;without rulers&quot;). Thus &quot;anarchism,&quot; in its most general meaning, is the belief that all forms of [[rulership]] are undesirable and should be abolished.

There are a variety of types and traditions of anarchism with various points of difference.&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkine, Petr Alekseevich. ''Anarchism: A Collection of Revolutionary Writings'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=R.B. Fowler|title=The Anarchist Tradition of Political Thought|year=1972|journal=Western Political Quarterly|volume=25|issue=4|pages=738-752|doi=10.2307/446800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than being opposed to the state, &quot;there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold, and those considered anarchists at best share a certain family resemblance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anarchism. The Oxford Companion to Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Preferred economic arrangements are one of the many areas of disagreement for anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868-1898&quot; [p. 135]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Pre-Nineteenth Century===
{{main|Origins of anarchism}}

Opposition to the state and hierarchical authority had a long history prior to the formation of the anarchist movement in nineteenth century Europe. Many claim that anarchist themes can be detected in works as old as those of the [[Taoist]] sage [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]]&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;&gt;Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html &quot;Anarchism&quot;, from The Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1910].&lt;/ref&gt;, though this is a controversial topic&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/sample/Clark--Anarchism.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;/&gt;

Anarchism in the modern sense, however, has its roots in the secular political thought of the [[Enlightenment]], particularly [[Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;''Anarchism'', Microsoft® Encarta® Online Encyclopedia 2006 (UK version) http://uk.encarta.msn.com © 1997-2006 Microsoft Corporation. All Rights Reserved
&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;anarchist&quot; was originally used as a term of [[abuse]], but by the [[French Revolution]] some groups such as the ''Enragés'' had started to use the term in a positive sense,&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Sean. ''Anarchism'', London: Reaktion Books Ltd., 2004. pg. 85&lt;/ref&gt; seeing the [[Jacobin]] concept of a &quot;revolutionary government&quot; as an oxymoron. It was in this political climate that [[William Godwin]] would develop his philosophy, which is considered by many to be the first expression of modern anarchist thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/godwin/ William Godwin] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, First published Sun Jan 16, 2000; substantive revision Sat May 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|130px|thumb|left|William Godwin]]

===William Godwin===
{{main|William Godwin}}
According to Peter Kropotkin, [[William Godwin]], in his ''Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' (2 vols., 1793), was &quot;the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1910&quot;/&gt; Charles A. Madison writes, &quot;The first modern systematic exponent of anarchism was William Godwin.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Strongly influenced by the sentiments of the French Revolution, he argued that since man is a rational being he must not be hampered in the exercise of his pure reason.  Moreover, since all forms of government have irrational foundations and are consequently tyrannical in nature, they must be swept away.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Madison&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Madison, Charles A.|year=1945|title=Anarchism in the United States|journal = Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=6|issue=1|pages=46-66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Godwin felt that the evil of man was the result of societal corruption, and his view was that government would become unnecessary as the human race is perfected.  &quot;Above all we should not forget, that government is an evil, an usurpation upon the private judgment and individual conscience of mankind; and that, however we may be obliged to admit it as a necessary evil for the present, it behoves us, as the friends of reason and the human species, to admit as little of it as possible, and carefully to observe whether, in consequence of the gradual illumination of the human mind, that little may not hereafter be diminished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;William Godwin, [http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pj51.html &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin felt that discrimination on any grounds besides ability was intolerable. Godwin is also well known for marrying the feminist [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]. Their daughter, [[Mary Shelley]], achieved fame as the author of ''[[Frankenstein]]''.

===Pierre-Joseph Proudhon===
{{main|Pierre-Joseph Proudhon}}
[[Image:Proudhon-children.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Proudhon and his children, by [[Gustave Courbet]], 1865]]
[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] is the first self-proclaimed anarchist, a label which he adopted in his 1840 treatise ''[[What Is Property?|What is Property?]]''. It is for this reason that some declare Proudhon the founder of modern anarchist theory.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Guerin, ''Anarchism: From Theory to Practice'' (New York: Monthly Review Press, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; He developed the theory of [[spontaneous order]] in society, whereby organization emerges without any central authority, a &quot;positive anarchy&quot; in which order arises from every individual &quot;doing what he wishes and only what he wishes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Proudhon, ''Solution to the Social Problem'', ed. H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p.45. &lt;/ref&gt; He saw anarchy as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness, formed through the development of science and law, is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties. In it, as a consequence, the institutions of the police, preventive and repressive methods, officialdom, taxation, etc., are reduced to a minimum. In it, more especially, the forms of monarchy and intensive centralization disappear, to be replaced by federal institutions and a pattern of life based on the commune.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Selected Writings'', Pierre-Joseph Proudhon&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His opposition to capitalism, the state, and organized religion inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading socialist theorists of his time.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB-Proudhon&quot;&gt; From Encyclopedia Britannica article &quot;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph&quot; (2006)[http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9276558]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was also opposed to &quot;communism, whether of the utopian or the Marxist variety, [the criticism being] that it destroyed freedom by taking away from the individual control over his means of production.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;EB-Proudhon&quot;/&gt;

==Schools of Anarchist Thought==
===Mutualism===
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}

While [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism as a body of economic ideas]] began in English and French labor movements of the 18th century, it later took on an anarchist form mostly associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. Proudhon was the first to call himself and his politics anarchist. In his landmark book ''[[What is Property?]]'' (''Qu'est-ce que la propriété?'', published in 1840), he expounded an economic theory based on a [[labor theory of value]], which states that the actual price of a thing (or the &quot;true cost&quot;) is the amount of labor that was undertaken to produce it. Consequently, no one who sells goods should charge more than the labor exerted to obtain or produce each good. According to Proudhon, &quot;It is labor, labor alone, that produces all the elements of wealth... according to a law of variable, but certain, proportionality.&quot; He was also careful to advise, however, that &quot;The value of labor is a figurative expression, an anticipation of effect from cause.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph ''The Philosophy of Poverty'' (1847)[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/philosophy/ch02.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Mutualist economics is characterised by a dedication to free association, a democratically run mutualist bank, and voluntary contract/federation.

Many mutualists believe that a market without government intervention would result in prices paid for labor to align with its true worth, as determined by the labor theory of value, because firms would be forced to compete over workers just as workers compete over firms, which would raise wages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualist.org/id112.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As [[William B. Greene]] put it:

:&quot;Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[William B. Greene|Greene, William B.]], &quot;Communism versus Mutualism,&quot; Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments. (Boston: Lee &amp; Shepard, 1875)&lt;/ref&gt;

Proudhon's mutualism, introduced into the United States in 1848 by Charles A. Dana,&lt;ref&gt;Dana, Charles A. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his &quot;Bank of the People&quot;] (1848).&lt;/ref&gt; supplemented a native American form already worked out by [[Josiah Warren]]. Proudhon's mutualism was adapted to American conditions by [[William B. Greene|Greene]], who introduced it to [[Benjamin R. Tucker]].&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin R., &quot;On Picket Duty,&quot; Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order)(1881-1908); Jan 5, 1889; 6, 10; APS Online
pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the American individualist anarchists, Proudhon emphasises associations amongst producers;&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodcock&quot;/&gt; thus, some see Proudhon's mutualism as being situated somewhere between individualism and collectivism.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princetone University Press 1996 ISBN 0-691-04494-5, p.6&lt;br/&gt;
Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collectivist Anarchism===
{{main|Collectivist anarchism}}
[[Image:Bakuninfull.jpg|thumb|right|Mikhail Bakunin]]

[[Collectivist anarchism]], also known as 'anarcho-collectivism', is most commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and the anti-authoritarian section of the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]] (1864-1876). Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. Workers would be compensated for their work on the basis of the amount of time they contributed to production, rather than goods being distributed &quot;according to need&quot; as in anarcho-communism. By the early 1880s, most of the European anarchist movement had adopted an [[Anarchist communism]] position, advocating the abolition of wage labour and distribution according to need rather than labor, although the [[Anarchism in Spain|early anarchist movement in Spain]] is sometimes associated with collectivism. Although the [[collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchists]] advocated compensation for labor, they held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need. &lt;ref&gt;Bakunin's associate, [[James Guillaume]], put it this way in his essay, ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm Ideas on Social Organization]''(1876):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
When… production comes to outstrip consumption… [e]veryone will draw what he needs from the abundant social reserve of commodities, without fear of depletion; and the moral sentiment which will be more highly developed among free and equal workers will prevent, or greatly reduce, abuse and waste.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Collective anarchism arose contemporary with [[Marxism]] but was opposed to it, despite Marxism striving for a collectivist stateless society, because of an opposition to the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin, Mikhail; ''[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm Statism and Anarchism]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship &amp;mdash; their dictatorship, of course &amp;mdash; can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchist communism===
{{main|Anarchist communism}}

[[Joseph Déjacque]] was an early anarchist communist and the first person to describe himself as &quot;[[libertarian socialism|socialist libertarian]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://joseph.dejacque.free.fr/ecrits/lettreapjp.htm De l'être-humain mâle et femelle - Lettre à P.J. Proudhon par Joseph Déjacque] (in [[French language|French]])&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Proudhon, he argued that &quot;it is not the product of his or her labor that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=Graham-05&gt;Graham, Robert ''Anarchism'' (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Other important anarchist communists include [[Peter Kropotkin]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Alexander Berkman]] and [[Errico Malatesta]]. Many in the anarcho-syndicalist movements (see below) saw anarchist communism as their objective. [[Isaac Puente]]'s 1932 ''[[libertarian communism|El comunismo libertario]]'' &lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;&gt;Puente, Isaac &quot;Libertarian Communism&quot; (The Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review' #6 Orkney 1982)[http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/libcom.html]&lt;/ref&gt; was adopted by the Spanish CNT as its manifesto for a post-revolutionary society.

Anarchist communists propose that a society composed of a number of [[self-governance|self-governing]] [[commune]]s with [[collectivism|collective]] ownership of the [[means of production]], ruled by [[direct democracy]], and related to other communes through [[federation]] would be the freest form of social organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;/&gt; In anarchist communism, individuals would not receive direct compensation for labour (through share of profits, payment or any other compensation), but would instead have free access to the resources of the commune.&lt;ref&gt;Miller. ''Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought'', Blackwell Publishing (1991) ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators believe that this would require an essentially communitarian human nature, but, according to the view developed by Kropotkin and later by [[Murray Bookchin]], the members of such a society will spontaneously perform all necessary labour because they will recognize the benefits of communal enterprise and mutual aid. &lt;ref&gt; Important treatises on this theory include:
* Kropotkin, Peter ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', 1998 paperback, London: Freedom Press. ISBN 0-900384-36-0, also at [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4341 Project Gutenburg]
* Kropotkin, Peter ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', first published 1892, also at [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/conquest/toc.html Anarchy Archives]
* Kropotkin, Peter ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]'', available at [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/kropotkin/fields.html Anarchy Archives]
* Bookchin, Murray ''[[Post Scarcity Anarchism]]'' (1971 and 2004) ISBN 1-904859-06-2.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often characterised as [[Utopianism]], a claim some do not deny,&lt;ref&gt;See the essay on utopianism in ''[[Post Scarcity Anarchism]]''&lt;/ref&gt; but anarchist communism is portrayed by its supporters as an achievable goal, if not an inevitability&lt;ref&gt;Durruti, Buenaventura &quot;We are not in the least afraid of ruins. We are going to inherit the earth, there is not the slightest doubt about that. The bourgeoisie might blast and ruin its own world before it leaves the stage of history. We carry a new world, here, in our hearts. That world is growing this minute.&quot; quoted on [http://libcom.org/history/durruti-buenaventura-1896-1936 libcom.org]&lt;/ref&gt;, rather than an impossible ideal.&lt;ref name=&quot;LibCom&quot;/&gt;

====Peter Kropotkin====
[[Image:PeterKropotkin.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Peter Kropotkin]]
[[Peter Kropotkin]], often seen as the most important theorist of anarchist communism, outlined his economic ideas in ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' and ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]''. Kropotkin felt that co-operation is more beneficial than competition, arguing in ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' that this was illustrated in nature. He advocated the abolition of private property through the &quot;expropriation of the whole of social wealth&quot; by the people themselves&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter. ''Words of a Rebel'', p99.&lt;/ref&gt;, and for the economy to be co-ordinated through a horizontal network of voluntary associations&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin|Kropotkin]], Peter. ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'', p145.&lt;/ref&gt;.

He maintained that, in anarcho-communism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;...houses, fields, and factories will no longer be private property, and that they will belong to the commune or the nation and money, wages, and trade would be abolished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/conquest/ch13.html Chapter 13 ''The Collectivist Wages System'' from ''The Conquest of Bread''], G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York and  London, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Individuals and groups would use and control whatever resources they needed, as the aim of anarchist-communism was to place &quot;the product reaped or manufactured at the disposal of all, leaving to each the liberty to consume them as he pleases in his own home.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Place of Anarchism in the Evolution of Socialist Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the expropriation of property to ensure that everyone would have access to what they needed without being forced to sell their labour to get it.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We do not want to rob any one of his coat, but we wish to give to the workers all those things the lack of which makes them fall an easy prey to the exploiter, and we will do our utmost that none shall  lack aught, that not a single man shall be forced to sell the strength of his right arm to obtain a bare subsistence for himself and his babes. This is what we mean when we talk of Expropriation...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin, Peter [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu:16080/Anarchist_archives/kropotkin/conquest/ch4.html The Conquest Of Bread Chapter IV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He said that a &quot;peasant who is in possession of just the amount of land he can cultivate,&quot; and &quot;a family inhabiting a house which affords them just enough space... considered necessary for that number of people&quot; and the artisan &quot;working with their own tools or handloom&quot; would not be interfered with&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin ''Act for yourselves.''  N.Walter and H. Becker, eds. (London: Freedom Press 1985) [p. 104-5]&lt;/ref&gt;, arguing that &quot;[t]he landlord owes his riches to the poverty of the peasants, and the wealth of the capitalist comes from the same source.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kropotkin &quot;The Conquest of Bread&quot; op cit&lt;/ref&gt;

====Platformism====
{{main|Platformism}}

Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist communist movement which shares an affinity with organising in the tradition of Nestor Makhno's Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft).  The Platform came from the experiences of Russian anarchists in the 1917 [[October Revolution]], which lead eventually to the victory of [[Bolshevik]] party dictatorship rather than workers' and peasants' self-management.  It argued for the &quot;vital need of an organization which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book | last = Dielo Trouda group | authorlink = Dielo Trouda | title = Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) | origyear = 1926 | url = http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 | accessdate = 2006-10-24 | year = 2006 | publisher = FdCA | location = Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarcho-syndicalism===
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[Image:Anarchist flag.svg|200px|right|thumb|Flag used by Anarcho-syndicalists.]]

The early twentieth century saw the rise of [[anarcho-syndicalism]] as a distinct school of thought within the anarchist tradition. More heavily focused on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, syndicalism posits trade unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society that is democratically self-managed by workers. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Three important principles of syndicalism are workers' solidarity, [[direct action]] (such as [[general strike]]s and [[recovered factory|workplace recuperations]]), and [[workers' self-management]]. Anarcho-syndicalism and other communitarian branches of anarchism are not mutually exclusive: anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to communist or collectivist schools of anarchism. Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution.

[[Rudolf Rocker]] was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarchosyndicalism''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html ''Anarchosyndicalism'' by Rudolph Rocker] ''retrieved 7 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Although more frequently associated with labor struggles of the early twentieth century (particularly in [[Anarchism in France|France]] and [[Anarchism in Spain|Spain]]), many syndicalist organizations are active today.

===Individualist anarchism===
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
[[Individualist anarchism]] is an anarchist philosophical tradition that has a strong emphasis on [[liberalism|equality of liberty]] and [[Self-ownership|individual sovereignty]], drawing much from the tradition of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Madison&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Madison, Charles A. | year = 1945 | title = Anarchism in the United States | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 46-66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchists believe that &quot;individual conscience and the pursuit of self-interest should not be constrained by any collective body or public authority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, Andrew, Key Concepts in Politics, Palgrave, ISBN 0-312-23381-7, 2000, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
====Egoism====
{{main|Max Stirner|Ethical egoism}}

[[Max Stirner]] was the author of a form of individualist anarchism called &quot;Egoism.&quot; Stirner's &quot;name appears with familiar regularity in historically-orientated surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of [[individualist anarchism]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SEP-Stirner&quot;&gt;Leopold, David &quot;Max Stirner&quot;, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2006 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2006/entries/max-stirner/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1844, Max Stirner's ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (sometimes translated as &quot;The Individual and His Property&quot;) was published, which is considered to be &quot;a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;SEP-Stirner&quot;/&gt; Stirner believed that most commonly accepted social institutions—including the concept of the state, property as a right, natural rights, and the very notion of society—were mere illusions or ''ghosts'' in the mind, saying of society that &quot;the individuals are its reality.&quot; He advocated egoism and a form of amoralism, in which individuals would unite in &quot;associations of egoists&quot; only when it was in their self interest to do so. For him, property simply comes about through might: &quot;Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property.&quot; And, &quot;What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing.&quot;

Stirner never called himself an anarchist; he accepted only the label &quot;egoist&quot;. Nevertheless, he is considered by most to be an anarchist because of his rejection of the state, law, and government. Also, his ideas influenced many anarchists, although interpretations of his thought are diverse. Anarchists including [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Federica Montseny]], and the [[Bonnot Gang]] claimed him as an influence, while [[Emma Goldman]] gave lectures on his thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/Goldman/Guide/chronology0119.html|title=Emma Goldman: Chronology 1901-1919|accessdate = 2006-05-30|publisher=Berkeley Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individualist anarchism in the United States====

{{main|Anarchism in the United States}}
[[Image:JosiahWarren.jpg|thumb|right|Josiah Warren was the first American individualist market anarchist]]

Individualist anarchism in the American tradition began with nineteenth century figures such as [[Josiah Warren]], [[Lysander Spooner]], [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], [[Victor Yarros]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Thoreau's individualist anarchism is purely philosophical and does not recommend any kind of action. Rather, it calls &quot;us to recognize the inevitability of self-government accompanied by atrophy of the State&quot; and argues that the state has no power other than what individuals accede to it.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ellwood. ''The Goodly Word: The Puritan Influence in America Literature'',  Clements Publishing, 2005, p. 138: &quot;...a political theory that has usually been named 'anarchist individualism'...The theory, however, does not advocate anarchism in the sense, for example, of the destruction of institutions; its purpose is only description. Emersonian and Thoreauavian anarchism does not call for any specifiable program of rebellion or destruction of social institutions, but merely asserts one abiding truth...&quot;  ''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences'', edited by Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman, Alvin Saunders Johnson, 1937, p. 12: &quot;The noblest and most eloquent statement of this essentially anarchist individualism came a generation later in Thoreau's essay on Civil Disobedience&quot; Bool, Henry, [http://praxeology.net/HB-AJA.htm'' Henry Bool's Apology for His Jeffersonian Anarchism''], 1901: &quot;I am a believer in the doctrines of the individualistic school of Anarchists, to which Garrison, Emerson, Proudhon, Thoreau, Spooner, Andrews, Warren and Tucker belong.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The anarchism of most of the other theorists is more elaborate.

Also known as the &quot;Boston anarchists,&quot; the nineteeth century individualists supported private property and a free market&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market - that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist.&quot; &quot;ANARCHISM AND PROPERTY&quot;, by Benjamin Tucker in &quot;The New Freewoman&quot;, [[November 15]] [[1913]]&lt;/ref&gt;, also advocating that protection of liberty and property should be provided by private contractors voluntarily funded in a [[free market]] rather than by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Tucker]], &quot;defense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices&quot; &quot;Instead of a Book&quot; (1893)&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Anarchism does not exclude prisons, officials, military, or other symbols of force. It merely demands that non-invasive men shall not be made the victims of such force. Anarchism is not the reign of love, but the reign of justice. It does not signify the abolition of force-symbols but the application of force to real invaders.&quot; Tucker, Benjamin. ''Liberty'' [[October 19]] [[1891]].&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike anarcho-communists, they supported a right to purchase the labour of others and for individuals to sell their own.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Benjamin. [http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker37.html Labor and Its Pay], from Individual Liberty: Selections from the Writings of Benjamin T. Tucker&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the state prevents true free competition in the market&lt;ref&gt;&quot;When Warren and Proudhon, in prosecuting their search for justice to labor, came face to face with the obstacle of class monopolies, they saw that these monopolies rested upon Authority, and concluded that the thing to be done was, not to strengthen this Authority and thus make monopoly universal, but to utterly uproot Authority and give full sway to the opposite principle, Liberty, by making competition, the antithesis of monopoly, universal.&quot; Tucker, Benjamin ''State Socialism and Anarchism'' (Liberty [[10 March]] [[1888]])&lt;/ref&gt;, which they thought prevented labor from receiving its true value in exchange. Accepting a labor theory of value, they believed that free-market competition would cause prices paid for labor, and the goods labor produces, to be proportional to the labor embodied in those goods and services. And they thought that unregulated banking and private money issuance would cause interest rates to drop to zero, because they thought this would increase the supply of money and intensify competition in lending.

[[Image:BenjaminTucker.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Benjamin Tucker]]]]
Benjamin Tucker, who was one of the most prominent individualist anarchists, opposed what he called four &quot;monopolies&quot;: the ''[[Federal Reserve|money monopoly]]'' (state control over currency, credit, and banks); the ''land monopoly'' of land-titles that remained in effect if individuals were not using their land; ''[[patent]]s'', which prohibit competition; ''[[tariff]]s'', which restrict competition in favor of established firms. There was also agreement among the early American individualists on the permissibility of employment (&quot;wage labour&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[I support individuals] carrying on business for themselves or from assuming relations between themselves as employer and employee if they prefer.&quot; Tucker, Benjamin. ''Liberty or Authority''&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike other  individualist anarchists, Spooner supported intellectual property rights &lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Lysander. [http://lysanderspooner.org/intellect/contents.htm ''The Law of Intellectual Property'']&lt;/ref&gt; and permitted absentee ownership of land.&lt;ref&gt;Watner, Carl.

Extremism in American: A Reader, NYU Press, 1995, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Like their predecessors, anarcho-capitalists would like for all services, including law enforcement and security, to be performed by multiple private providers all competing for business, rather than by a monopolist state agency funded by taxation. Anarcho-capitalism's leading proponents are [[Murray Rothbard]], [[David Friedman]] and [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]. It has been influenced by libertarians such as [[Gustave de Molinari]], [[Frederic Bastiat]], [[Ayn Rand]] and [[Robert Nozick]].

Although anarcho-capitalism was also influenced by [[Benjamin Tucker|Tucker]] and [[Lysander Spooner|Spooner]]&lt;ref&gt;DeLeon, David. The American as Anarchist: Reflections on Indigenous Radicalism. John Hopkins University Press, 1978, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;, it rejects their [[labor theory of value]] in favor of the modern neo-classical [[Marginalism|marginalist]] view. Thus, anarcho-capitalists, like modern economists, do not believe that prices in a free market are, or would be, proportional to labor times (nor do they think that &quot;usury,&quot; &quot;exploitation,&quot; or &quot;profit&quot; is taking place if that does not happen). They believe that different prices of goods and services in a market, whether completely free or not, are the result of individuals making subjective judgements on the [[marginal utility]] of goods and services rather than on the amounts of labor embodied in them. Also anarcho-capitalists disagree with Tucker that interest would disappear with unregulated banking and money issuance. Rothbard believed that people in general do not wish to lend their money to others without compensation, so there is no reason why this would change just because banking is unregulated (nor does he agree that unregulated banking would increase the supply of money in the first place)&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray. The Spooner-Tucker Doctrine: An Economist's View [http://www.mises.org/journals/jls/20_1/20_1_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;. Anarcho-capitalism has a theory of [[legitimacy]] that supports private property as long as it was obtained by labor, trade, or gift.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray (1969) ''[http://mises.org/journals/lf/1969/1969_06_15.pdf Confiscation and the Homestead Principle]'' The Libertarian Forum Vol. I, No. VI ([[June 15]] [[1969]]) Retrieved [[5 August]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most anarcho-capitalists believe that in the absence of aggression, including the instutionalized aggression carried on by the state, free capitalism would naturally and inevitably develop. Hence, Rothbard's statement that &quot;capitalism is the fullest expression of anarchism, and anarchism is the fullest expression of capitalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard103.html ''Exclusive Interview With Murray Rothbard''] The New Banner: A Fortnightly Libertarian Journal ([[25 February]] [[1972]])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anarchism without adjectives===
{{main|Anarchism without adjectives}}

[[Image:Cleyere.gif|thumb|150px|right|[[Voltairine de Cleyre]]]]
''Anarchism without adjectives'', in the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, &quot;referred to an [[hyphen|unhyphenated]] form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as [[Anarchist communism|communist]], [[collectivism|collectivist]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]], or [[individualist anarchism|individualist]]. For others, ... [it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Esenwein, George Richard &quot;Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868-1898&quot; [p. 135] &lt;/ref&gt;. It arose as the result of being troubled by the &quot;bitter debates&quot; between the different movements and was a call for more tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anarchism without adjectives'' emphasizes harmony between various anarchist factions and attempts to unite them around their shared anti-authoritarian beliefs. The expression was coined by [[Cuba|Cuban]]-born [[Fernando Tarrida del Marmol]], who used it in November [[1889]] in [[Barcelona]].

To these anarchists, economic preferences are considered to be of secondary importance to abolishing all coercive authority. [[Rudolf Rocker]], who was one of these anarchists, said that the different types of anarchism presented &quot;only different methods of economy, the practical possibilities of which have yet to be tested, and that the first objective is to secure the personal and social freedom of men no matter upon which economics basis this is to be accomplished.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Avrich, Paul. Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Voltairine de Cleyre]] was one of the most prominent &quot;anarchists without adjectives&quot;. Although she initially identified herself as an individualist anarchist, she later espoused a collectivist form of anarchism,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The best thing ordinary workingmen or women could do was to organise their industry to get rid of money altogether . . . Let them produce together, co-operatively rather than as employer and employed; let them fraternise group by group, let each use what he needs of his own product, and deposit the rest in the storage-houses, and let those others who need goods have them as occasion arises.&quot; Voltairine De Cleyre, &quot;Why I Am an Anarchist&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; while refusing to identify herself with any of the contemporary schools. She commented that &quot;Socialism and Communism both demand a degree of joint effort and administration which would beget more regulation than is wholly consistent with ideal Anarchism; Individualism and Mutualism, resting upon property, involve a development of the private policeman not at all compatible with my notion of freedom.&quot; In The Making of an Anarchist, she wrote, &quot;I no longer label myself otherwise than as 'Anarchist' simply.&quot;

[[Errico Malatesta]] was another proponent of anarchism-without-adjectives, stating that &quot;[i]t is not right for us, to say the least, to fall into strife over mere hypotheses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted by Max Nettlau, A Short History of Anarchism [p. 198-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anarchism as a Social Movement==
Individualist anarchism does not represent the majority of anarchists; most anarchists favor some form of communitarianism or collectivism.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Larry. ''Politics: An Introduction to the Modern Democratic State'', Broadview Press (2001), pp.  146-147&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy of collectivism and violent revolution dominated mainstream anarchism from the days of the [[First International]] until the destruction of anarchism as a mass movement at the end of the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;&quot;Anarchism.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica, from Encyclopaedia Britannica 2003 Ultimate Reference Suite CD-ROM.

===The First International===
{{main|International Workingmen's Association|Anarchism and Marxism}}
[[Image:ait.jpg|thumb|left|The Masonic &quot;level in a circle&quot; as used by the Federal Council of Spain of the International Workingmen's Association. Note the inclusion of the Plumb, one of the working tools of a operative masonry, and a symbol of rectitude of conduct]]In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]]. Twenty years later in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]], sometimes called the 'First International', united some diverse European revolutionary currents, including French followers of [[Proudhon]], [[Blanquists]], English trade unionists, [[socialists]] and [[social democrats]]. Due to its genuine links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization.

[[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] joined in 1868, allying with the anti-authoritarian socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property. At first, the [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarized into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.

Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year = 1991|title =Statism and Anarchy | publisher = Cambridge University Press|location = | id = ISBN 0-521-36973-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups, when, at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], Marx engineered the expulsion of Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] from the International and had its headquarters transferred to New York. In response, the anti-authoritarian sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.&lt;ref name=Graham-05/&gt;

===Anarchism and organized labor===
[[Image:CNT_tu_votar_y_ellos_deciden.jpg|thumb|175px|CNT poster from April 2004. Reads: Don't let the politicians rule our lives/ You vote and they decide/ Don't allow it/ Unity, Action, Self-management.]]
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchism in Spain}}

The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to &quot;replace the privilege and authority of the State&quot; with the &quot;free and spontaneous organization of labor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p.100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Confédération Générale du Travail]] (General Confederation of Labour, CGT), formed in France in 1895,  was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement, but it had been preceded by the Spanish Workers Federation in 1881.  Anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics and played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America.

The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[CNT]].  CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Carley, Mark &quot;Trade union membership 1993-2003&quot; (International:SPIRE Associates 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]], also remain active.

===The Russian Revolution===
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}

Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned or driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In the [[Ukraine]], anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against Whites and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Makhnovshchina peasant army led by [[Nestor Makhno]].

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]]  were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote classic accounts of their experiences in Russia, aiming to expose the reality of Bolshevik control. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You can see quite well that behind all the democratic and socialistic phrases and promises in Marx’s program for the State lies all that constitutes the true despotic and brutal nature of all states, regardless of their form of government.&quot; Bakunin, Mikhail (1872) &quot;On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx&quot;  (Bakunin on Anarchy, translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971)[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; Communist parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US, for example, the major syndicalist movements of the [[CGT]] and [[IWW]] began to realign themselves away from anarchism and towards the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the [[Platformism|Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]]
&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book | last = Dielo Trouda group | authorlink = Dielo Trouda | title = Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) | origyear = 1926 | url = http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 | accessdate = 2006-10-24 | year = 2006 | publisher = FdCA | location = Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland and the [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] of North America.

===The fight against fascism===
{{main|Anti-fascism|Anarchism in Spain}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|left|thumb|270px|[[Spain]], 1936. Members of the [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s to fight against the [[fascist]]s in one of the [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factories.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s, the familiar dynamics of anarchism's conflict with the state were transformed by the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. Anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation '''Arditi del Popolo.''' This group was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and marked up numerous successful victories, including driving back [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922&lt;ref&gt;Holbrow, Marnie &quot;Daring but Divided&quot;  (Socialist Review Nov 2002)[http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In France, where the fascists came close to insurrection in the February 1934 riots, anarchists divided over a 'united front' policy.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, David &quot;Fascism or Revolution&quot; (Le Libertaire August, 1936)[http://raforum.apinc.org/article.php3?id_article=238]&lt;/ref&gt; In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-1939) was underway.

In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinists]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government. According to [[George Orwell]] and other foreign observers, Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident Marxists]] and anarchists.

==Issues in anarchism==
===Ends and means===
{{main|Propaganda of the deed|direct action}}
Generally, anarchists advocate [[direct action]] and oppose voting in elections. Most anarchists feel that real change is not possible through voting. Further, many argue that voting is equivalent to condoning the state,&lt;ref&gt;*[[Joe Peacott|Peacott, Joe]], [http://world.std.com/~bbrigade/badbsd8.htm &quot;Voting Anarchists: An Oxymoron or What?&quot;] BAD Broadside #8, Boston Anarchist Drinking Brigade 1992
*[[Colin Ward|Ward, Colin]] [http://www.takver.com/history/elections/ward_on_voting.htm &quot;The Case Against Voting&quot;], originally published in New Society 15 May 1987; reprinted in Freedom Vol 48 No 6 June 1987.
*[http://www.infoshop.org/voting.html Choose and Lose - The anarchist case against voting and electoralism] infoshop.org&lt;/ref&gt; while others advocate a more pragmatic approach, including voting in referendums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/ws/2002/ws69/referendum.html Thinking about anarchism - Referendums] Workers Solidarity No 69, published in March 2002 ''retrieved 7 September 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct action may be violent or non-violent. Although some anarchists believe that violence is justified in overthrowing existing authority, most anarchists reject [[terrorism]] as authoritarian. [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Errico Malatesta]], for example, wrote of violence as necessary in revolutionary settings, but denounced terrorism as counter-revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Bakunin, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1869/program.htm &quot;The Program of the International Brotherhood&quot;] (1869) and Malatesta, [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm &quot;Violence as a Social Factor&quot;] (1895).&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchists have often been portrayed as dangerous and violent, due mainly to a number of high-profile violent acts, including [[riot]]s, [[assassination]]s, [[insurrection]]s, and [[terrorism]] by some anarchists, as well as persistently negative media portrayals.&lt;ref&gt;Albert, Michael [http://www.zmag.org/anarchism.htm Anarchism?!], Z Communications ''retrieved 6 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Many anarchists do not see the destruction of property as a violent act. Anarchists see war, however, as an activity in which the state seeks to gain and consolidate power, both domestically and in foreign lands, and subscribe to [[Randolph Bourne]]'s view that &quot;war is the health of the state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://struggle.ws/hist_texts/warhealthstate1918.html War is the Health of the State]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many anarchists participate in subversive organizations as a means to undermine the Establishment, such as [[Food Not Bombs]], [[IWW|radical labor unions]], [[indymedia|alternative media]], and [[infoshop|radical social centers]].  This is in accordance with the anarchist concept of [[Dual Power]]: creating the structures for a new anti-authoritarian society in the shell of the old, hierarchical one.

===Capitalism===
{{main|Anarchism and capitalism}}

Most anarchist traditions not only seek rejection of the [[state]], but also of [[capitalism]], which they perceive as authoritarian, coercive, and exploitative. For mutualists, this opposition does not include opposition to the product of labor or capital goods (&quot;means of production&quot;) run by individuals, but only &quot;[[usury]]&quot;, i.e. rent, interest, and profit from other's labor (profit being defined as labor not receiving its &quot;full product&quot; under the labor theory of value). Thus individualist anarchists, even those who are not anarcho-capitalist, support [[individual sovereignty]], free trade, free competition, and private property, like in [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and [[homesteading]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Madison&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Madison, Charles A. | year = 1945 | title = Anarchism in the United States | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 46-66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Madison2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Madison, Charles A. | year = 1943 | title = Benjamin R. Tucker: Individualist and Anarchist | journal = New England Quarterly | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 444-467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Globalization===
{{cleanup-section|October 2006}}
The majority of anarchists oppose [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] [[globalization]] as an attempt to use coercion on a global scale, carried out through institutions such as the [[World Bank]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[G8]] and [[World Economic Forum]]. Anarchist groups, such as [[Reclaim the Streets]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/features/new_world_disorder/reclaim.html Reclaim the Streets] Donnacha DeLong, RTÉ News Online 2002 ''retrieved 5 September 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;, were among the instigators of the so-called [[anti-globalization movement]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://newleftreview.org/A2368 The New Anarchists] David Graeber, New Left Review 13, January-February 2002 ''retrieved 6 September 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Carnival Against Capitalism]] on [[18 June]] [[1999]] is generally regarded as the first of the major anti-globalization protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/features/new_world_disorder/action2.html G8 Summit - J18: Global Carnival Against Corporate Tyranny, London, England] C. L. Staten, EmergencyNet News journalist, writing for [[RTÉ]]'s website in 2002 ''retrieved 5 September 2006''&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchists, such as the [[WOMBLES]], often played a major role in planning, organising and participating in the subsequent protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/00000006D8CF.htm WOMBLES wandering free] Josie Appleton, spiked-politics, 2002 ''retrieved 5 September 2006''&lt;/ref&gt; The protests tended to be organised on anarchist [[direct action]] principles with a general tolerance for a range of different activities ranging from those who engage in [[tactical frivolity]] to the [[black bloc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thrall.orcon.net.nz/21scapegoat.html Anarchism as a Scapegoat of the 21st century: violence, anarchism and anti-globalisation protests] Thrall issue #21, 2001 ''retrieved 5 September 2006''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communism===
While communism is proposed as a form of social and economic organisation by many anarchists, other anarchists consider it a danger to the liberty and free development of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.zabalaza.net/texts/txt_com&amp;anok_pk.htm Communism and Anarchy]'' by Peter Kropotkin&lt;/ref&gt; Individualist anarchists oppose communism in all its forms. Individualist such as Benjamin Tucker, Victor Yarros, and Henry Appleton have denied that [[anarcho-communism]] is a genuine form of anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, [[Benjamin Tucker]] says, &quot;Yes, genuine Anarchism is consistent [[Manchesterism]], and Communistic or pseudo-Anarchism is inconsistent Manchesterism.&quot; (Tucker, Benjamin. [http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker37.html Labor and Its Pay], from Individual Liberty: Selections from the Writings of Benjamin T. Tucker); [[Victor Yarros]] says, &quot;There is no logical justification, no rational explanation, and no scientific reasoning has been, is, will be, or can be advanced in defence of that unimaginable impossibility, Communistic Anarchism.&quot; (Yarros, Victor S. [http://www.againstpolitics.com/market_anarchism/yarros_princely.html A Princely Paradox], Liberty, Vol 4. No. 19, Saturday, April 9, 1887, Whole Number 97) [[Henry Appleton]] says, &quot;All Communism, under whatever guise, is the natural enemy of Anarchism, and a Communist sailing under the flag of Anarchism is as false a figure as could be invented.&quot; (Appleton, Henry. [http://praxeology.net/HA-ATF.htm Anarchism, True and False], Liberty 2.24, no. 50, 6 September 1884, p. 4.) [[Clarence Lee Swartz]] says, &quot;&quot;One of the tests of any reform movement with regard to personal liberty is this: Will the movement prohibit or abolish private property? If it does, it is an enemy of liberty. For one of the most important criteria of freedom is the right to private property in the products of ones labor. State Socialists, Communists, Syndicalists and Communist-Anarchists deny private property.&quot; (Swartz, Clarence Lee. [http://www.panarchy.org/swartz/mutualism.index.html What is Mutualism?])&lt;/ref&gt; They rejected its strategies and argued that it is inherently authoritarian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;&gt;Brooks, Frank H. (ed) (1994) ''The Individualist Anarchists: An Anthology of Liberty (1881-1908)'', Transaction Publishers, p.76&lt;/ref&gt; The socialist [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]] also opposed communism, &quot;whether of the utopian or the Marxist variety, [the criticism being] that it destroyed freedom by taking away from the individual control over his means of production.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; From Encyclopedia Britannica article [http://www.britannica.com/ebi/article-9276558 &quot;Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph&quot;] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Anarchist communists reject the criticism, pointing to the principle of [[voluntary association]] that underpins the theory.

===Gender===
{{main|Anarcha-feminism}}
Anarcha-feminism is a kind of [[radical feminism]] that espouses the belief that [[patriarchy]] is a fundamental problem in society. However, it was not explicitly formulated as ''anarcha-feminism'' until early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarcha.org/sallydarity/Anarcho-FeminismTwoStatements.htm Anarcho-Feminism - Two Statements - Who we are: An Anarcho-Feminist Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[second-wave feminism|second-wave]] feminist movement. Anarcha-feminism views [[patriarchy]] as the first manifestation of hierarchy in human history; thus, the first form of oppression occurred in the dominance of male over female.

===Race===
{{main|Antifa}}
[[Black anarchism]] opposes the existence of a state, capitalism, and subjugation and domination of people of colour, and favours a non-hierarchical organization of society. Theorists include [[Ashanti Alston]], [[Lorenzo Komboa Ervin]], and [[Sam Mbah]].

Since the late 1970s some anarchists have been involved in fighting the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups. In Germany and [[Great Britain]] some anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left. They advocated directly combating fascists with physical force rather than relying on the state. Since the late 1990s, a similar tendency has developed within US anarchism.

===The environment===
{{seealso|Green anarchism|Eco-anarchism|Social ecology|Anarcho-primitivism|Ecofeminism|Green syndicalism}}

[[Image:Zerzan.jpeg|thumb|left|The [[Anarcho-primitivism|Anarcho-primitivist]] [[John Zerzan]]]]

The environment and sustainability have been an issue for anarchists from at least as far back as Kropotkin's '[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]], but since the late 1970s anarchists in [[Anglosphere]] and European countries have been agitating for the natural environment. [[Eco-anarchism|Eco-anarchists]] or [[Green anarchism|green anarchists]] believe in [[deep ecology]]. This is a worldview that embraces [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. Eco-anarchists often use [[direct action]] against what they see as earth-destroying institutions. Of particular importance is the [[Earth First!]] movement, that takes action such as [[tree sitting]]. The more militant [[Earth Liberation Front]], which grew out of Earth First!, also has connections with the anarchist movement. Another important component is [[ecofeminism]], which sees the domination of nature as a metaphor for the domination of women.

[[Anarcho-primitivism|Anarcho-Primitivism]] is a predominantly Western philosophy that advocates a return to a pre-industrial and usually pre-agricultural society. It develops a critique of industrial civilization. In this critique [[technology]] and [[technology development|development]] have [[alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world. This philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. Some primitivists advocate a complete process of '[[rewilding]]' and a return to [[nomadic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles while others only wish to see an end to industrial society and do not oppose [[domestication]] or [[agriculture]].  Key theorists in the former category include [[Derrick Jensen]] and [[John Zerzan]] while the 'Unabomber' [[Theodore Kaczynski]] belongs in the latter. Today there is much conflict between primitivists and followers of more traditional forms of [[class struggle]] anarchism, such as the [[social ecology]] of [[Murray Bookchin]].

===Religion===
[[Image:LeoTolstoy.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The novelist and [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] [[Leo Tolstoy]]]]{{main|Anarchism and religion|Buddhist anarchism|Christian anarchism|Islam and anarchism}}
From [[Proudhon]] and [[Bakunin]] to the Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, Anarchists have traditionally been skeptical about and opposed to [[organized religion]], believing that most organized religions are [[hierarchical]] in nature and, more often than not, aligned with contemporary power structures like [[state]] and [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Nonetheless, there are those who reconcile anarchism with religion.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]] believe that there is no higher authority than [[God]], and oppose earthly authority such as [[government]] and established churches. They believe that Jesus' teachings and the practice of the [[early church]] were clearly anarchistic, but were corrupted when &quot;Christianity&quot; was declared the official religion of Rome.  Though he did not call himself an anarchist because he applied the term to those who wanted to change society through violence&lt;ref&gt;Woodcock, George. Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements, Broadview Press, 2004, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Leo Tolstoy]] is considered to be the most famous Christian anarchist whose '[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]' is considered a key Christian anarchist text. The [[Catholic Worker Movement]] is a modern Christian anarchist organisation.

[[Buddhist anarchism]] originated in the [[Chinese anarchism|Chinese Anarchist]] movemnt of the 1920s, [[Taixu]], one of the leading thinkers and writers of this school, was deeply influenced by [the work of christian anarchists like [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and by the ancient Chinese [[well-field system]].   A much more recent incarnation of this school of thought was popularized by [[Jack Keroac]] in his book ''[[The Dharma Bums]]''.

In the late 1800's the [[Ghadar]] movement in India (see [[Har Dayal]]), influenced by [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought and by [[Swami Dayananda Saraswati]] (founder of [[Arya Samaj]]),  saw anarchism as a way of propagating the ancient culture of the [[Arya]]. (Not to be confused with the much later appropriation of &quot;Aryan&quot; identity by [[German]] [[Fascists]]).  &lt;ref&gt;''Ghadar Movement: Ideology, Organisation and Strategy'', Harish K. Puri, Guru Nanak Dev University Press, Amritsar: ''&quot;The only account of Hardayal's short stay in that island [[Martinique]],  comes from [[Bhai Parmanand]], a self exiled [[Arya Samaj]]ist missionary from [[Lahore]], who stayed a month with him there. Har Dayal used that time, says Parmanand, to discuss plans to found a new religion: his model was the Buddha. He ate mostly boiled grain, slept on the bare floor and spent his time in meditation in a secluded place. [[Guy Aldred]], a famous English radical and friend, tells us of Hardayal's proclaimed belief at that time in the coming republic &quot;which was to be a Church, a religious confraternity . . . its motto was to be: atheism, cosmopolitanism and moral law' Parmamand says that Har Dayal acceded to his persuasion to go to the USA and decided to make New York a centre for the propagation of the ancient culture of the Aryan.&quot;'' (page 55) and ''&quot;the ideal social order would be the one which approximated to the legendary Vedic period of Indian history because, as Har Dayal affirmed, practical equality existed only in that society, where there were no governors and no governed, no priests and no laymen, no rich and no poor.&quot;'' (page 112]], referencing ''The Social Conquest of the Hindu Race and Meaning of Equality''.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Recent Developments within Anarchism==
Anarchism generates many eclectic and syncretic philosophies and movements. Since the Western social ferment in the 1960's and 1970's a number of new movements and schools have appeared. Most of these stances are limited to even smaller numbers than the schools and movements listed above.
*'''Especifismo''' -  [[Especifismo]] emerged out of nearly 50 years of anarchist experiences in South America starting with the Federación Anarquista Uruguaya (FAU), founded in 1956 by anarchists who saw the need for an organization which was specifically anarchist.  It has been summmarised as;
&quot;The need for specifically anarchist organization built around a unity of ideas and praxis.
The use of the specifically anarchist organization to theorize and develop strategic political and organizing work.
Active involvement in and building of autonomous and popular social movements, which is described as the process of &quot;social insertion.&quot;&lt;ref name=Especifismo&gt;{{cite book | last = NEFAC | authorlink = Adam Weaver | title = Especifismo: The Anarchist Praxis of Building Popular Movements and Revolutionary Organization in South America | origyear = 2006 | url = http://www.anarkismo.net/newswire.php?story_id=2999&amp;search_text=especifismo | accessdate = 2006-10-24 | year = 2006 | publisher = NEFAC | location = USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other organisations that hold to Especifismo include Federação Anarquista Gaúcha (FAG), the Federação Anarquista Cabocla (FACA), and the Federação Anarquista do Rio de Janeiro (FARJ) (all in Brazil), and the Argentinean organization Auca (Rebel).
Especifismo is considered to have come to broadly similar conclusions to the Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) leading to the argument that it is properly considered a new form of [[Platformism]]
[[Image:Hakim Bey.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Peter Lamborn Wilson]]]]
*'''Post-left anarchy''' - [[Post-left anarchy]] seeks to distance itself from the traditional &quot;left&quot; - communists, socialists, social democrats, etc. - and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary &quot;leftist&quot; movements and single issue causes ([[anti-war]], [[anti-nuclear]], etc.). It calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. Important groups and individuals associated with Post-left anarchy include: [[CrimethInc]], the magazine [[Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed]] and its editor [[Jason McQuinn]], [[Bob Black]], [[Hakim Bey]] and others.
*'''Post-Anarchism''' - The term [[post-anarchism]] was originated by [[Saul Newman]], first receiving popular attention in his book ''[[From Bakunin to Lacan]]'' to refer to a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken on a life of its own and a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], [[post-left anarchy]], [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that it should be a coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include [[Saul Newman]], [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]].
*'''Insurrectionary anarchism''' - [[Insurrectionary anarchism]] is a form of revolutionary anarchism critical of formal anarchist labor unions and federations. Insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organization, including small affinity groups, carrying out acts of resistance in various struggles, and mass organizations called base structures, which can include exploited individuals who are not anarchists. Proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]], author of works including &quot;Armed Joy&quot; and &quot;The Anarchist Tension&quot;. This tendency is represented in the US in magazines such as [[Willful Disobedience]] and [[Killing King Abacus]].
*'''Small 'a' anarchism''' - Small 'a' anarchism is a term used in two different, but not unconnected contexts. Dave Neal posited the term in opposition to big 'A' Anarchism in the article [http://www.spunk.org/library/intro/practice/sp001689.html Anarchism: Ideology or Methodology?]. While big 'A' Anarchism referred to ideological Anarchists, small 'a' anarchism was applied to their methodological counterparts; those who viewed anarchism as &quot;a way of acting, or a historical tendency against illegitimate authority.&quot; As an anti-ideological position, small 'a' anarchism shares some similarities with [[post-left anarchy]]. [[David Graeber]] and [[Andrej Grubacic]] offer an alternative use of the term, applying it to groups and movements organising according to or acting in a manner consistent with anarchist principles of decentralisation, voluntary association, mutual aid, the network model, and crucially, &quot;the rejection of any idea that the end justifies the means, let alone that the business of a revolutionary is to seize state power and then begin imposing one's vision at the point of a gun.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=41&amp;ItemID=4796 Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century] by David Graeber
and Andrej Grubacic&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of anarchism==
{{main|Criticisms of anarchism}}
The theory and practice of anarchism has been controversial since it came to prominence in the 19th century. Some of the criticisms made of anarchism come from the interests it opposes, such as governments. Other criticisms have been made internally of other anarchists or by political movements that appear to share similar goals, such as [[Marxism]]. Many question the idealist nature of anarchism, and have misgivings about its practical application in the real world. Some point to anarchism's inability to establish a viable anti-state. Some social scientists note that hierarchies appear to be synonymous with human civilization, although others note that many indigenous societies have been largely egalitarian.

==Cultural phenomena==
[[Image:Noam chomsky cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Noam Chomsky]] (1928–)]]
The kind of anarchism that is most easily encountered in popular culture is represented by well-known figures who publicly identify themselves as anarchists. The following figures are examples of prominent publicly self-avowed anarchists:
*the [[MIT]] professor of [[linguistics]] [[Noam Chomsky]]
*the social historian [[Howard Zinn]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Something of an anarchist,&quot; [http://perspectives.anarchist-studies.org/13zinn.htm War is the Health of the State: An Interview with Howard Zinn], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*author [[Edward Abbey]]
*author and speaker [[Murray Bookchin]]
*author and philosopher [[Robert Anton Wilson]]
*[[graphic novel]]ist [[Alan Moore]]
*[[UFC]] fighter and champion [[Jeff Monson]]
*[[feminist]], author and critic [[Germaine Greer]]
*[[Hans Alfredson]], actor, film director, writer and comedian.
*Hip Hop musician [[Emcee Lynx]]

In [[Denmark]], the [[Freetown Christiania]] was created in downtown [[Copenhagen]]. The housing and employment crisis in most of [[Western Europe]] led to the formation of [[commune (intentional community)|communes]] and squatter movements like the one still thriving in [[Barcelona]], in [[Catalonia]]. Although not always explicitly anarchist, militant [[antifa|resistance to neo-Nazi groups]] in places like Germany, and the uprisings of [[autonomous Marxism]], [[situationist]], and [[Autonomist]] groups in France and Italy also helped to give popularity to anti-authoritarian, non-capitalist ideas.

In various musical styles, anarchism rose in popularity. Most famous for the linking of anarchist ideas and music has been [[punk rock]], although in the [[modern age]], [[hip hop]], and [[folk music]] are also becoming important mediums for the spreading of the anarchist message. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]] this was associated with the [[Punk subculture|punk]] movement; the band [[Crass]] are celebrated for their anarchist and [[pacifism|pacifist]] ideas, while [[Chumbawamba]] are the arguably the best known UK anarchist band, having  made some inroads into the realms of '[[Music charts|popular chart music]]'.  The [[post-rock]], [[modern classical]] band [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] has often associated itself with anarchism proved by their dislike of people trying to claim one or another member the band's leader.
''For further details, see [[anarcho-punk]] and [[list of anarchist musicians]].''

Recent technological developments have made the transmission of anarchist ideas accessible to a wider public. Many people use the Internet to form on-line communities. [[Intellectual property]] has been undermined to some extent and a gift-culture supported by [[file sharing|sharing music files]], collaborative software development, and [[free software]] ([[Alternative terms for free software|also called]] [[open-source software]]) has arisen. These cyber-communities include those that support [[GNU]], [[Linux]], [[Indymedia]], and [[Wiki]]s. Others use technology to remain anonymous, communicate securely using [[public key cryptography]], and maintain financial privacy through [[digital currency]]. ''See also'': [[Crypto-anarchism]] and [[Cypherpunk]].

 Name = Childhood autism |
 ICD10 = {{ICD10|F|84|0|f|80}} |
 ICD9 = {{ICD9|299.0}} |
}}
'''Autism''' is classified as a [[Neural development|neurodevelopmental]] [[disorder]] that manifests in delays of &quot;social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play,&quot; with &quot;onset prior to age 3 years,&quot; according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]. The [[ICD|ICD-10]] also requires symptoms to be &quot;manifest before the age of three years.&quot; Autism is often not [[Physiology|physiologically]] obvious, in that outward appearance may not indicate a disorder, and diagnosis typically comes from a complete physical and [[Neurology|neurological]] evaluation. Some now speculate that autism is not a single condition but a group of several distinct conditions that manifest in similar ways.{{fact}}

There have been large increases in the reported [[Autism (incidence)|incidence of autism]], for reasons that are heavily debated by [[research]]ers in [[psychology]] and related fields within the [[scientific community]]. Some estimate that autism currently occurs in as many as one child in 166 in the [[United States]].{{fact}} However, the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] gives a more conservative estimate of one in 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NIH Autism Overview 2005 | url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/upload/autism_overview_2005.pdf | accessdate=2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the specific [[causes of autism]] are unknown, many researchers suspect that autism results from genetically mediated vulnerabilities to environmental triggers. While there is disagreement about the magnitude, nature, and mechanisms for such environmental factors, researchers have found seven genes prevalent among individuals diagnosed as autistic.{{fact}} Further, observations such as autistic children having generally larger head circumferences &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courchesneautismlab.org/headcircumference.html]&lt;/ref&gt; are intriguing, but their roles in the disorder are unclear. Promising research continues, however; researchers at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]], for example, have found a link between autism, abnormal blood vessel function, and oxidative stress (the result of higher levels of [[free radicals]]). This suggests that doors may be opened to new medical therapies if researchers can find more evidence linking decreased blood flow to the brain and oxidative stress with the pathology of autism. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Penn Researchers Find Link Between Autism and Abnormal Blood-Vessel Function and Oxidative Stress | url=http://www.uphs.upenn.edu/news/News_Releases/aug06/autbldvsl.htm | accessdate = August 15 | accessyear=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With intense therapy (most notably [[Applied Behavioral Analysis]]), practice, and schooling, some children with diagnosed autism may improve their social and other skills, but there are no indications that a cure for autism is within sight. Some autistic children and adults who are able to communicate (at least in writing) are opposed to attempts to cure their autism, because they (and/or the guardians) see autism as part of who they are.

==History==
[[image:Asperger_kl2.jpg|frame|right|Dr. [[Hans Asperger]] described a form of autism in the 1940s that later became known as [[Asperger's syndrome]].]]

The word &quot;autism&quot; was first used in the [[English language]] by [[Switzerland|Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Eugene Bleuler]] in a 1912 issue of the ''American Journal of Insanity''. It comes from the Greek word for &quot;self,&quot; αυτος (''autos''). Bleuler used it to describe the [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic's]] seeming difficulty in connecting with other people.

However, the [[Medical classification|classification]] of autism did not occur until 1943 when psychiatrist Dr. [[Leo Kanner]] of the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] reported on 11 child patients with striking behavioral similarities and introduced the label &quot;early infantile autism.&quot; He suggested the term &quot;autism&quot; to describe the fact that the children seemed to lack interest in other people. Kanner's first paper on the subject was published in a now defunct journal ''The Nervous Child'', and almost every characteristic he originally described is still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders.

At the same time, an [[Austria]]n scientist named Dr. [[Hans Asperger]] made similar observations, although his name has since become attached to a different higher-functioning form of autism known as [[Asperger's syndrome]]. Widespread recognition of Asperger's work was delayed by [[World War II]] in [[Germany]], and by his seminal paper not being translated into English for almost 50 years. The majority of his work wasn't widely read until 1997.

Autism and Asperger's Syndrome are today listed in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV-TR]] as two of the five [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are also referred to as [[Autistic spectrum|autism spectrum disorders]] (ASD). All of these conditions are characterized by varying degrees of deficiencies in [[communication skill]]s and social interactions, along with restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of [[Human behavior|behavior]].

==Terminology==
{{wiktionarypar2|autism|autistic}}
When referring to someone who is diagnosed with autism, the term &quot;autistic&quot; is often used. Alternatively, many prefer to use the [[person-first terminology]] &quot;person with autism&quot; or &quot;person who experiences autism.&quot; However, the [[autistic community]] generally prefers &quot;autistic&quot; for reasons that are fairly controversial.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.autismsocietyofwa.org/DiaryJuly-Aug05.pdf The Diary, July-August 2005], publication of the Autism Society of Washington, accessed [[24 August]] [[2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; This article uses both terminologies.

==Characteristics==

Individuals diagnosed with autism can vary greatly in skills and behaviors, and their [[sensory system]] is quite different from that of other people. Certain [[stimulation]]s, such as sounds, lights, and touch, will often affect someone with autism differently than someone without, and the degree to which the sensory system is affected can vary greatly from one individual to another. On the surface, individuals who have autism are physically indistinguishable from those without. Sometimes autism co-occurs with other disorders, and in those cases outward differences may be apparent. Enlarged brain size appears to accompany autism, but the effects of this are still unknown&lt;ref&gt;Hardan, A., Minshew, N., Mallikarjuhn, M., Keshavan, M. (2001). Brain Volume in Autism. ''Journal of Child Neurology, 16'', 421-424. [http://www.wpic.pitt.edu/research/CeFAR/PDF/Brain%20Volume%20in%20autism.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In assessing developmental delays, different physicians may not always arrive at the same conclusions. Much of this is due to the somewhat vague diagnostic criteria for autism, paired with an absence of objective diagnostic tests. Nevertheless, professionals within [[pediatrics]], child psychology, [[behavior analysis]], and child development are always looking for early indicators of autism in order to initiate treatment as early as possible for the greatest benefit.

===Social development===
Typically-developing infants are social beings&amp;mdash;early in life they gaze at people, turn toward voices, grasp at fingers, and smile. In contrast, most autistic children do not show special interest in faces and seem to have tremendous difficulty learning to engage in everyday human interaction. Even in the first few months of life, many autistic children seem indifferent to other people, lacking the eye contact and interaction with others that non-autistic children are expected to exhibit. Some infants with autism may appear very calm &amp;mdash; they may cry less often because they do not seek parental attention or ministration.

Autistic children often seem to prefer being alone and may passively accept such things as hugs and cuddling without reciprocating, or resist attention altogether. Later, they seldom seek comfort from others or respond to parents' displays of [[anger]] or [[affection]] in a typical way. Research has suggested that although autistic children are attached to their parents, their expression of this attachment may be unusual and difficult to interpret.{{fact}} Parents who looked forward to the joys of cuddling, teaching, and playing with their child may feel crushed by this lack of expected [[attachment theory|attachment]] behavior.

According to [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] et al.&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, S., Leslie, A., &amp; Frith, U. (1985). Does the autistic child have a 'theory of mind'? ''Cognition, 21'', 37-46.[http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~aleslie/Baron-Cohen%20Leslie%20&amp;%20Frith%201985.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;, many autistic children appear to lack a &quot;[[theory of mind]],&quot; which is the ability to see things from another person's perspective. This is a behavior cited as being exclusive to human beings above the age of five and possibly, to a lesser degree, to other higher [[primate]]s such as adult [[gorilla]]s, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]] and [[bonobos]].{{fact}} Typical 5-year-olds can usually develop insights into other people's knowledge, feelings, and intentions based on social cues (e.g., gestures and [[facial expression]]s). An autistic individual may lack these interpretation skills, leaving them unable to predict or understand other people's actions or intentions.

Children with autism often experience [[social alienation]] during their school-age years. As a response to this, or perhaps because their social surroundings simply do not &quot;fit&quot; them, many report inventing [[imaginary friend]]s, worlds, or scenarios.{{fact}} Making friends in real life and maintaining those friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism.

Although not universal, it is common for autistics to have difficulty regulating their behavior, resulting in crying, verbal outbursts, or self-injurious behaviors that seem inappropriate or without cause. Those who have autism generally prefer consistent routines and environments, and they may react negatively to changes in their surroundings. It is not uncommon for these individuals to exhibit aggression, increased levels of self-stimulatory behavior, self-injury, or extensive withdrawal in overwhelming situations. However, as the child matures and receives education/training, he or she can gradually learn to control such behaviors and cope with difficult changes in other ways.

===Sensory system===
Clinicians making a proper assessment for autism would look for symptoms much like those found in [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|sensory integration dysfunction]]. Children will exhibit problems coping with normal sensory input. Indicators of autism include oversensitivity or underreactivity to touch, movement, sights, or sounds; physical clumsiness or carelessness; poor body awareness; a tendency to be easily distracted; impulsive physical or verbal behavior; an activity level that is unusually high or low; not unwinding or calming oneself; difficulty learning new movements; difficulty in making transitions from one situation to another; social and/or emotional problems; delays in [[Speech delay|speech]], [[Language delay|language]] or [[motor skills]]; specific learning difficulties/delays in academic achievement. However, it is essential to remember that while most people with autism have some degree of sensory integration difficulty, not every person who has sensory problems is autistic.

One common example is autistic [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]]. An autistic person may have trouble hearing certain people while other people are perceived as speaking at a higher volume. Or the autistic may be unable to filter out sounds in certain situations, such as in a large crowd of people (see [[cocktail party effect]]). However, this is perhaps  a part of autism that tends to vary widely from person to person, so these examples may not apply to every autistic person. Note that such auditory difficulties fall under auditory processing disorders, and like sensory integration dysfunction, are not necessarily experienced by all people with autism or indicative of a diagnosis of autism.

===Communication difficulties===
By age 3, typical children have passed predictable language learning milestones; one of the earliest is babbling. By the first birthday, a typical toddler says words, turns when he or she hears his or her name, points when he or she wants a toy, and when offered something distasteful, makes it clear that the answer is &quot;no.&quot; It should be noted, however, that late language development does occur in a minority of neurotypical children.

Speech development in people with autism takes different paths than the majority of neurotypical children. Some remain [[mute]] throughout their lives with varying degrees of [[literacy]]; communication in other ways&amp;mdash;images, visual clues, [[sign language]], and [[typing]] may be far more natural to them. Contrary to the prevailing traditional stereotype of mute people with Kanner-type autism, around one third of people diagnosed with this type of autism will develop what is often viewed as ''[[dysfunctional]]'' verbal language, relying on rote learned stored phrases, songs, jingles and advertisements.  Those with the autism spectrum condition of [[Semantic Pragmatic Disorder]] fall into this group.

Those who do speak sometimes use [[language]] in unusual ways, retaining features of earlier stages of language development for long periods or throughout their lives. Some speak only single words, while others repeat a mimicked phrase over and over. Some repeat what they hear, a condition called [[echolalia]]. Sing-song repetitions in particular are a calming, joyous activity that many autistic adults engage in. Many people with autism have a strong [[tonality|tonal]] sense, and can often understand at least some spoken language whilst others can understand language fluently.

Some children may exhibit only slight delays in language, or even seem to have precocious language and unusually large [[vocabulary|vocabularies]], but have great difficulty in sustaining typical [[conversation]]s. The &quot;give and take&quot; of non-autistic conversation is hard for them, although they often carry on a [[monologue]] on a favorite subject, giving no one else an opportunity to comment. When given the chance to converse with other autistics, they comfortably do so in &quot;parallel monologue&quot;&amp;mdash;taking turns expressing views and information. Just as &quot;[[neurotypical]]s&quot; (people without autism) have trouble understanding autistic [[body language]]s, vocal tones, or phraseology, people with autism similarly have trouble with such things in people without autism. In particular, autistic language abilities tend to be highly literal; people without autism often inappropriately attribute hidden meaning to what people with autism say or expect the person with autism to sense such unstated meaning in their own words.

Some people with high-functioning Autism demonstrate advanced cognitive ability, but lack the skills or are not inclined to interact with others socially. An example of the this is the noted autistic [[Temple Grandin]], who holds a PhD and is a successful developer of livestock handling technologies.  She memorably describes her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals as leaving her feeling &quot;like an anthropologist on Mars.&quot; Temple's case was described by neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] in his 1995 book titled &quot;[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]: Seven Paradoxical Tales.&quot;

Some infants who later show signs of autism coo and babble during the first few months of life, but stop soon afterwards. Others may be delayed, developing language as late as the [[adolescence|teenage]] years. Still, inability to speak does not mean that people with autism are unintelligent or unaware. Once given appropriate accommodations, some will happily converse for hours, and can often be found in online [[chat room]]s, discussion boards or [[website]]s and even using communication devices at autism-community social events such as [[Autreat]].

Sometimes, the body language of people with autism can be difficult for other people to understand. Facial expressions, movements, and gestures may be easily understood by some other people with autism, but do not match those used by other people. Also, their tone of voice has a much more subtle inflection in reflecting their feelings, and the [[auditory system]] of a person without autism often cannot sense the fluctuations. What seems to non-autistic people like odd [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]; things like a high-pitched, sing-song, or flat, [[robot]]-like voice may be common in autistic children and some will have combinations of these prosody issues. Some autistic children with relatively good language skills speak like little adults, rather than communicating at their current age level, which is one of the things that can lead to problems.

Since non-autistic people are often unfamiliar with the autistic [[body language]], and since autistic natural language may not tend towards speech, autistic people often struggle to let other people know what they need. As anybody might do in such a situation, they may scream in frustration or resort to grabbing what they want. While waiting for non-autistic people to learn to communicate with them, people with autism do whatever they can to get through to them. Communication difficulties may contribute to autistic people becoming socially anxious or depressed or prone to self-injurious behaviours. Recently, with the awareness that those with autism can have more than one condition a significant percentage of people with autism are being diagnosed with co-morbid mood, anxiety and compulsive disorders which may also contribute to behavioural and functioning challenges.

===Repetitive behaviors===
Although people with autism usually appear physically normal and have good muscle control, unusual repetitive motions, known as self-stimulation or &quot;[[stimming]]&quot;, may set them apart. These behaviors might be extreme and highly apparent or more subtle. Some children and older individuals spend a lot of time repeatedly flapping their arms or wiggling their toes, others suddenly freeze in position. As children, they might spend hours lining up their cars and trains in a certain way, not using them for the type of pretend play expected of a non-autistic child. If someone accidentally moves one of these toys, the child may be tremendously upset. Autistic children often need, and demand, absolute consistency in their environment. A slight change in any routine&amp;mdash;in mealtimes, dressing, taking a bath, or going to school at a certain time and by the same route&amp;mdash;can be extremely disturbing to them. Autistics sometimes have persistent, intense preoccupations. For example, the child might be obsessed with learning all about [[computers]], [[TV program]]s and [[movie]] schedules or [[lighthouses]]. Often they show great interest in different languages, numbers, symbols or [[science]] topics. Repetitive behaviors can also extend into the spoken word as well. Perseveration of a single word or phrase, even for a specific number of times can also become a part of the child's daily routine.

===Effects in education===
Children with autism are affected by their symptoms every day, which set them apart from unaffected students. Because of problems with [[receptive language]] and [[theory of mind]], they can have difficulty understanding some classroom directions and instruction, along with subtle vocal and facial cues of teachers. This inability to fully decipher the world around them often makes education stressful. Teachers need to be aware of a student's disorder, and ideally should have specific training in autism education, so that they are able to help the student get the best out of his or her classroom experiences.

Some students learn more effectively with visual aids as they are better able to understand material presented visually. Because of this, many teachers create “visual schedules” for their autistic students. This allows students to concretely see what is going on throughout the day, so they know what to prepare for and what activity they will be doing next. Some autistic children have trouble going from one activity to the next, so this visual schedule can help to reduce stress.

Research has shown that working in pairs may be beneficial to autistic children.{{fact}} Autistic students have problems not only with language and communication, but with socialization as well. By facilitating peer interaction, teachers can help their students with autism make friends, which in turn can help them cope with problems. This can help them to become more integrated into the mainstream environment of the classroom.

A teacher's aide can also be useful to the student. The aide is able to give more elaborate directions that the teacher may not have time to explain to the autistic child and can help the child to stay at a equivalent level to the rest of the class through the special one-on-one instruction. However, some argue that students with one-on-one aides may become overly dependent on the help, thus leading to difficulty with independence later on.

There are many different techniques that teachers can use to assist their students. A teacher needs to become familiar with the child’s disorder to know what will work best with that particular child. Every child is going to be different and teachers have to be able to adjust with every one of them.

Students with autism spectrum disorders sometimes have high levels of [[anxiety]] and stress, particularly in social environments like school. If a student exhibits aggressive or explosive behavior, it is important for educational teams to recognize the impact of stress and anxiety. Preparing students for new situations, such as through writing [[social stories]], can lower anxiety. Teaching social and emotional concepts using systematic teaching approaches such as The Incredible 5-Point Scale or other cognitive behavioral strategies can increase a student's ability to control excessive behavioral reactions.

==DSM definition==
Autism is defined in section 299.00 of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV) as:
#A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3):
##qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following:
###marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction
###failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level
###a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (e.g., by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest)
###lack of social or emotional reciprocity
##qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following:
###delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gesture or mime)
###in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others
###stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language
###lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level
##restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following:
###encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus
###apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional routines or rituals
###stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (e.g., hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements)
###persistent preoccupation with parts of objects
#Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years:
##social interaction
##language as used in social communication
##symbolic or imaginative play.
#The disturbance is not better accounted for by [[Rett syndrome|Rett's Disorder]] or [[Childhood disintegrative disorder|Childhood Disintegrative Disorder]].

These are rules of thumb and may not necessarily apply to all diagnosed autistics.

==Types of autism ==
Autism presents in a wide degree, from those who are nearly [[dysfunctional]] and apparently [[Developmental Disability|mentally handicapped]] to those whose symptoms are mild or remedied enough to appear unexceptional (&quot;normal&quot;) to others. Although not used or accepted by professionals or within the literature, autistic individuals are often divided into those with an [[Intelligence Quotient|IQ]]&lt;80 referred to as having &quot;low-functioning autism&quot; (LFA), while those with IQ&gt;80 are referred to as having &quot;high-functioning autism&quot; (HFA). Low and high functioning are more generally applied to how well an individual can accomplish activities of daily living, rather than to [[IQ]]. The terms low and high functioning are controversial and not all autistics accept these labels.

This discrepancy can lead to confusion among service providers who equate IQ with functioning and may refuse to serve high-IQ autistic people who are severely compromised in their ability to perform daily living tasks, or may fail to recognize the intellectual potential of many autistic people who are considered LFA. For example, some professionals refuse to recognize autistics who can speak or write as being autistic at all, because they still think of autism as a communication disorder so severe that no speech or writing is possible.

As a consequence, many &quot;high-functioning&quot; autistic persons, and autistic people with a relatively high [[IQ]], are under diagnosed, thus making the claim that &quot;autism implies retardation&quot; self-fulfilling. The number of people diagnosed with LFA is not rising quite as sharply as HFA, indicating that at least part of the explanation for the apparent rise is probably better diagnostics. Many also think that ASD's are being over diagnosed: (1) because the growth in the number and complexity of symptoms associated with autism has increased the chances professionals will erroneously diagnose autism and (2) because the growth in services and therapies for autism has increased the number who falsely qualify for those often free services and therapies.

===Asperger's and Kanner's syndrome===
{{main|Asperger syndrome}}
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Hans Asperger.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Asperger described his patients as &quot;little professors&quot;.]] --&gt;
In the current [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), the most significant difference between Autistic Disorder (Kanner's) and Asperger's syndrome is that a diagnosis of the former includes the observation of &quot;delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication, or (3) symbolic or imaginative play&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=BehaveNet autism description | url=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/autistic.htm | accessdate = July 30 | accessyear=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome observes &quot;no clinically significant delay&quot; in the latter two of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=BehaveNet aspergers description | url=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm | accessdate = July 30 | accessyear=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst the DSM-IV does not include level of intellectual functioning in the diagnosis, the fact that those with Asperger's syndrome tend to perform better than those with Kanner's autism has produced a popular conception that [[Asperger's syndrome]] is synonymous with &quot;higher-functioning autism&quot;, or that it is a lesser [[disorder]] than autism. Similarly, there is a popular conception that autistic individuals with a high level of intellectual functioning in fact have Asperger's syndrome, or that both types are merely '[[geek]]s' with a medical label attached. The popular depiction of autism in the media has been of relatively severe cases, for example, as seen in the films ''[[Rain Man]]'' (autistic adult) and ''[[Mercury Rising]]'' (autistic child), and in turn many relatives of those who have been diagnosed in the autistic spectrum choose to speak of their loved ones as having Asperger's syndrome rather than autism.

===Autism as a spectrum disorder===
{{details|Autistic spectrum}}

Another view of these disorders is that they are on a continuum known as [[autistic spectrum]] disorders. Autism spectrum disorder is an increasingly popular term that refers to a broad definition of autism including the classic form of the disorder as well as closely related conditions such as PDD-NOS and Asperger's syndrome. Although the classic form of autism can be easily distinguished from other forms of autism spectrum disorder, the terms are often used interchangeably.

A related continuum, [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction]], involves how well humans integrate the information we receive from our senses. Autism, Asperger's syndrome, and Sensory Integration Dysfunction are all closely related and overlap.

Some people believe that there might be two manifestations of classical autism, [[regressive autism]] and [[early infantile autism]]. Early infantile autism is present at birth while regressive autism begins before the age of 3 and often around 18 months. Although this causes some controversy over when the neurological differences involved in autism truly begin, some speculate that an environmental influence or toxin triggers the disorder. This triggering could occur during gestation due to a toxin that enters the mother's body and is transferred to the fetus. The triggering could also occur after birth during the crucial early nervous system development of the child.

A paper published in 2006 concerning the behavioral, cognitive, and genetic bases of autism argues that autism should perhaps not be seen as a single disorder, but rather as a set of distinct symptoms (social difficulties, communicative difficulties and repetitive behaviors) that have their own distinct causes.&lt;ref&gt;Happe F, Ronald A, Plomin R. Time to give up on a single explanation for autism. Nat Neurosci. 2006 Oct;9(10):1218-20.[http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v9/n10/full/nn1770.html]&lt;/ref&gt; An implication of this would be that a search for a &quot;cure&quot; for autism is unlikely to succeed if it is not examined as separate, albeit overlapping and commonly co-occurring, disorders.

==Epidemiology of autism==
{{further|[[Frequency of autism]] and [[Autism (incidence)]].}}
;Sex differences
Overall, autism is three to four times more common in boys than girls.{{fact}} However, at the more severe end of the spectrum, the ratio of boys to girls is closer to 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;Volkmar, F.R., Szatmari, P. &amp; Sparro, S.S.  (1993).  Sex differences in pervasive developmental disorders. ''Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 23(4),'' 579-591.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a study published in 2006 indicates that men over 40 are almost six times more likely than younger men to father a child with autism, and that the ratio of autistic boys to autistic girls with older fathers was again closer to 1:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Reichenberg | first=Abraham | coauthors=et al. |
title=Advancing Paternal Age and Autism | journal=Archives of General Psychiatry | volume=63 | issue=9 | date=September 2006 | pages=1026-1032 | format = [[PDF]]|url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/63/9/1026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Reported increase with time
[[Image:autismnocgraph.png|right|thumb|400px|The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically over a decade. Statistics in graph from the [[National Center for Health Statistics]].]]
There was a worldwide increase in reported cases of autism over the decade to 2006, which may echo the pattern following the description of [[schizophrenia]]&lt;!-- and [[multiple personality disorder]] {{fact}}--&gt; in the twentieth century&lt;!-- this might be improved to make it more clear when the description, and when the increase were, with dates--&gt;. There are several theories about the apparent sudden increase.

Many epidemiologists argue that the rise in the incidence of autism in the United States is largely attributable to a broadening of the diagnostic concept, reclassifications, public awareness, and the incentive to receive federally mandated services (for example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jick | first=H | coauthors=JA Kaye |
title=Epidemiology and causes of autism | journal=Pharmacotherapy | volume=23 | issue=12 | date=December 2003 | pages=1524-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, some authors indicate that the existence of an as yet unidentified contributing environmental risk factor cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rutter | first=M | title=Incidence of autism spectrum disorders:  changes over time and their meaning | journal=Acta Paediatrica | volume=94 | issue=1 | date=January 2005 | pages=2-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, a widely-cited pilot study conducted in California by the UC Davis [[M.I.N.D. Institute]] ([[17 October]] [[2002]]), reported that the increase in autism is real, even after accounting for changes to diagnostic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Report to the Legislature on the Principal Findings of the Epidemiology of Autism in California Pilot Study | url=http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/newsroom/study_final.pdf | accessdate=September 18 | accessyear=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of whether the rise in incidence is real or an artifact of improved diagnosis and a broader concept of autism remains controversial.  Dr. Chris Johnson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center at [[San Antonio]] and co-chair of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] Autism Expert Panel, sums up the state of the issue by saying, &quot;There is a chance we're seeing a true rise, but right now I don't think anybody can answer that question for sure.&quot; ([[Newsweek]] reference below).

The answer to this question has significant ramifications on the direction of research, since a real increase would focus more attention (and research funding) on the search for environmental factors, while the alternative would focus more attention to genetics. On the other hand, it is conceivable that certain environmental factors (such as chemicals, infections, medicines, [[vaccine]]s, diet and societal changes) may have a particular impact on people with a specific genetic constitution.

One of the more popular theories is that there is a connection between &quot;geekdom&quot; and autism. This is hinted, for instance, by a ''Wired Magazine'' article in 2001 entitled &quot;The [[Geek]] Syndrome&quot;, which is a point argued by many in the autism rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Silberman | first=Steve | title=The Geek Syndrome | date=December 2001|publisher=Wired|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aspergers_pr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article, many professionals assert, is just one example of the media's application of mental disease labels to what is actually variant normal behavior&amp;mdash;they argue that shyness, lack of athletic ability or social skills, and intellectual interests, even when they seem unusual to others, are not in themselves signs of autism or Asperger's syndrome. &lt;!--this sentence is repetitive really--&gt;Others assert that children who in the past would have simply been accepted as a little different or even labeled 'gifted' are now being labelled with mental disease diagnoses. See [[clinomorphism]] for further discussion of this issue.

Due to the recent publicity surrounding autism and autistic spectrum disorders, an increasing number of adults are choosing to seek diagnoses of high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in light of symptoms they currently experience or experienced during childhood. Since the cause of autism is thought to be at least partly genetic, a proportion of these adults seek their own diagnosis specifically as follow-up to their children's diagnoses. Because autism falls into the [[pervasive developmental disorder]] category, strictly speaking, symptoms must have been present in a given patient before age seven in order to make a [[differential diagnosis]].

==Therapies==
{{main|Autism therapies}}

There is a broad array of '''autism therapies''', but the [[efficacy]] of each varies dramatically from person to person.  Progress toward development of medical and [[behavior]] modification remedies, for the more debilitating affects of autism, has been hindered significantly by widespread disagreements over such things as the nature and causes of [[autistic spectrum]] disorders, and by a relative paucity of efficacious therapies thus far recognized by medical authorities.

==Causes==
{{main|Causes of autism}}

The '''causes and etiology of autism''' is an area of debate and controversy. There is currently no consensus, and researchers are studying a wide range of possible causes. Since autistic people are all somewhat different from one another, there are likely multiple &quot;causes&quot; that interact with each other in subtle and complex ways, and thus give slightly differing outcomes in each individual. A theory featuring [[mirror neurons]]&lt;ref&gt;Oberman L., Hubbard E., McCleery J., Altschuler E., Ramachandran V., Pineda J. (2006). EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders, ''Brain Research: Cognitive Brain Research, 24(2)'', 190-198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dapretto, M. (2006). Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders. ''Nature Neuroscience, 9(1)'', 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt; states that autism may involve a dysfunction of specialized neurons in the brain that should activate when observing other people. In typically-developing people, these mirror neurons are thought to perhaps play a major part in [[social learning]] and general comprehension of the actions of others.
There is also a large genetic component to autism&lt;ref&gt;Yu C., Dawson G., Munson J., D'Souza I., Osterling J., Estes A., Leutenegger A., Flodman P., Smith M., Raskind W., Spence M., McMahon W., Wijsman E., Schellenberg G. (2002). Presence of Large Deletions in Kindreds with Autism. ''American Journal of Human Genetics, 71'', 100-115.&lt;/ref&gt;. Originally hinting toward this was the observation that there is about a 60% concordance rate for autism in monozygotic (identical) [[twin]]s&lt;ref&gt;Bailey A., Le Couteur A., Gottesman I., Bolton P., Simonoff E., Yuzda E., Rutter M. (1995). Autism as a strongly genetic disorder: evidence from a British twin study. ''Psycholigical Medicine, 25'', 63–77.&lt;/ref&gt;, while dizygotic (non-identical) twins and other siblings only exhibit about 4% concordance rates&lt;ref&gt;Bolton P., MacDonald H., Pickles A., Rios P., Goode S., Crowson M., Bailey A., Rutter M. (1994). A case-control family history study of autism. ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 35'', 877–900.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Sociology==
Due to the complexity of autism, there are many facets of [[sociology]] that need to be considered when discussing it, such as the culture which has evolved from autistic persons connecting and communicating with one another. In addition, there are several subgroups forming within the autistic community, sometimes in strong opposition to one another.

==Community and politics==
{{further|[[Autistic community]] and [[Autism rights movement]].}}

Curing autism is a very highly [[controversial]] and [[politicized issue]]. What some call the &quot;autistic community&quot; has splintered into several strands. Some seek a cure for autism - sometimes dubbed by ''pro-cure''.  Others do not desire a &quot;cure&quot;, and as such resist it. They are sometimes dubbed ''anti-cure''. Many more may have views between these two. Recently, with scientists learning more about autism and possibly coming closer to effective remedies, some members of the &quot;anti-cure&quot; movement [[Autistic community#Declaration from the autism community|sent a letter to the United Nations]] demanding to be treated as a [[minority group]] rather than a group with a [[mental disability]] or disease. Web sites such as [http://www.autistics.org autistics.org]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=autistics.org: The REAL Voice of Autism (See above) | url=http://www.autistics.org | accessdate = December 11 | accessyear=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; present the view of the anti-cure group.

There are many resources available for autistic people. Because many autistics find it easier to communicate online than in person, a large number of these resources are online. In addition, successful autistic adults in a local community will sometimes help children with autism, using their own experience in developing coping stategies and/or interacting with society.

The year 2002 was declared [[Autism Awareness Year]] in the [[United Kingdom]]&amp;mdash;this idea was initiated by [[Ivan and Charika Corea]], parents of an autistic child, Charin. Autism Awareness Year was led by the [[British Institute of Brain Injured Children]], [[Disabilities Trust]], [[National Autistic Society]], [[Autism London]] and 800 organizations in the United Kingdom. It had the personal backing of [[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and parliamentarians of all parties in the [[Palace of Westminster]].

===Culture===
{{details|Autistic culture}}

With the recent increases in autism recognition and new approaches to educating and socializing autistics, an ''autistic culture'' has begun to develop. Similar to [[deaf culture]], autistic culture is based in a belief that autism is a unique way of being and not a disorder to be cured. There are some commonalities which are specific to autism in general as a culture, not just &quot;autistic culture&quot;.

It is a common misperception that autistic people do not marry; many do seek out close relationships and marry. Often, they marry another autistic, although this is not always the case. Autistic people are often attracted to other autistic people due to shared interests or obsessions, but more often than not the attraction is due to simple compatibility with personality types, the same as for non-autistics. Autistics who communicate have explained that companionship is as important to autistics as it is to anyone else. Multigenerational autistic families have also recently become a bit more noticeable{{fact}}.

It is also a common misperception that autistic people live away from other people, such as in a [[rural]] area rather than an [[urban area|urban]] area; many autistics do happily live in a [[suburb]] or large city. However, a metropolitan area can provide more opportunities for cultural and personal conflicts, requiring greater needs for adjustment.

Parents and relatives of autistic adults strongly fear their loved ones would be unsuspected victims of [[crime]] and [[fraud]], and autistic adults are said to end up a target for [[hate crimes]]. In the U.S. it is a federal felony for one to purposely attack an individual for their [[disability]].

The interests of autistic people and so-called &quot;[[geeks]]&quot; or &quot;[[nerd]]s&quot; can often overlap as autistic people can sometimes become preoccupied with certain subjects, much like the variant normal behavior &lt;!-- &quot;variant normal behaivor&quot;? What the deuce does that mean? --&gt; geeks experience. However, in practice many autistic people have difficulty with working in groups, which impairs them even in the most 'geeky' of situations. The connection of autism with so-called geek or nerd behavior has received attention in the popular press, but is still controversial within these groups.

Speculation arises over famous people and celebrities are now suspected, but unconfirmed, of having autism and Asperger's syndrome. They are rumored to have most symptoms of autism or autistic-spectrum disorder. Biographers, personal physicians and media journalists continually investigate these rumors or the claims are actually [[libel]]ious of their character as public figures, being singled out as &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;nerdy&quot; people. ''{{citation needed}}''

===Autistic adults===
Communication and social problems often cause difficulties in many areas of the autistic's life. Far fewer adult autistics marry or have children than the general population. Even when they do marry it is more likely to end in divorce than the norm..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Asperger syndrome and adults, Dr Isabelle Henault | url=http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Asperger_syndrome_and_adults?open | accessdate = June 12 | accessyear=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, far fewer autistic adults live in [[metropolitan areas]] than the general population, and even if they live near metro areas they are more likely going to experience [[bullying]] and [[poverty]] than the norm {{fact}}. Nevertheless, as more social groups form, progressively more diagnosed adults are forming relationships with others on the spectrum.

A small proportion of autistic adults, usually those with high-functioning autism or [[Asperger's syndrome]], are able to work successfully in mainstream jobs, although frequently far below their actual level of skills and qualification. Some have managed self-employment; many of those are listed on self-employment sites such as [http://www.auties.org Auties.org].

Others are employed in sheltered workshops under the supervision of managers trained in working with persons with disabilities. A nurturing environment at home, at school, and later in job training and at work, helps autistic people continue to learn and to develop throughout their lives.

It is often said that the [[Internet]], since it is almost devoid of the non-verbal cues that autistics find so hard to interact with, has given some autistic individuals an environment in which they can, and do, communicate and form online communities. The internet has also provided the option of occupations such as, [[Telecommuting|teleworking]] and independent consulting, which, in general, do not require much human interaction offline.

Under the public law, in the [[United States]], the public schools' responsibility for providing services ends when the autistic person is 21 years of age. The autistic person and their family are then faced with the challenge of finding living arrangements and employment to match their particular needs, as well as the programs and facilities that can provide support services to achieve these goals.

However autism can be a [[poverty]] trap for adult and young autistics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parl.gc.ca/39/1/parlbus/chambus/house/debates/008_2006-04-24/han008_1310-E.htm&lt;/ref&gt; many of whom are engaged in unskilled jobs for which they are overqualified{{fact}}, or on welfare benefits. Many parents of autistic children also face financial difficulties as they must often pay for essential support and therapeutic services. Furthermore, autistics who might qualify for [[welfare (financial aid)|financial assistance]] in one country are not eligible in another, as since some nations do not recognize autism as a disability.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daylon.com/autism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nas.org.uk/content/1/c4/28/61/ignored.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism and blindness===
The characteristics of a person with both an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and a severe visual impairment (VI) may vary from a person with just ASD or just VI,&lt;ref&gt;Gense, Marilyn H., and D. Jay Gense. &quot;Autism Spectrum Disorders in Learners with Blindness/Vision Impairments.&quot; RE:View (1994). 5 May 2006 &lt;http://focusfamilies.org/focus/docs/blindnessandautism.pdf PDF&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been observations of relatively high co-occurrence of the two.{{fact}}

Developmental trajectories of children with ASD-VI are often very similar as those followed by children with typical autism, but the child with ASD-VI will have particularly unusual responses to sensory information. He or she may be overly sensitive to touch or sound, or be under responsive to pain. Typically, touch, smell, and sound are affected the most dramatically. Unusual posture or hands movements are common, and very difficult to redirect. These are so common because of the sensory input issues in addition to the lack of visual modeling.

===Autistic savants===
{{Main|autistic savant}}
The autistic savant phenomenon is sometimes seen in autistic people. Estimates of the prevalence of this phenomenon range between 1% and 10%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Savant prevalence | url=http://wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/savant/synopsis_article.cfm | accessdate = June 23 | accessyear=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to describe a person who is autistic and has extreme talent in a certain area of study. Although there is a common association between savants and autism (an association made especially popular by the 1988 film ''[[Rain Man]]''), most autistic people are not [[savant]]s and savantism is not unique to autistic people, though there does seem to be some relation&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, P. &amp; Wallace, G.L. (2004). Annotation: The savant syndrome. ''Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 45(5),'' 899-911.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Mental calculator]]s and fast [[computer programming]] skills are the most common form. A well known example is [[Daniel Tammet]], the subject of the [[documentary film]] ''[[The Brain Man]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Guardian &quot;Brain Man&quot; article | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/weekend/story/0,3605,1409903,00.html|accessdate = July 30|accessyear=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Kim Peek]], one of the inspirations for [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character in the film ''[[Rain Man]]'', is not autistic). &quot;Bright Splinters of the Mind&quot; is a book that explores this issue further.

==Other pervasive developmental disorders==
Autism and Asperger's syndrome are just two of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). The three other pervasive developmental disorders are [[Rett syndrome]], [[Childhood disintegrative disorder]], and [[PDD not otherwise specified|Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]]. Some of these are related to autism, while some of them are entirely separate conditions.

===Rett syndrome===
[[Rett syndrome]] is relatively rare, affecting almost exclusively females, one out of 10,000 to 15,000. After a period of normal development, sometime between 6 and 18 months, autism-like symptoms begin to appear. The little girl's mental and social development regresses; she no longer responds to her parents and pulls away from any social contact. If she has been talking, she stops; she cannot control her feet; she wrings her hands. Some of these early symptoms may be confused with autism. Some of the problems associated with Rett syndrome can be treated. [[Physical therapy|Physical]], [[Occupational therapy|occupational]], and [[Speech therapy|speech]] therapy can help with problems of coordination, movement, and speech.

Scientists sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development have discovered that a mutation in the sequence of a single gene causes Rett syndrome, and can physically test for it with an 80% accuracy rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NIH Rett description | url=http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/rett/detail_rett.htm | accessdate = July 30 | accessyear=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rett syndrome in the past was sometimes classified as an autistic spectrum disorder, however most scientists agree that Rett syndrome is a separate developmental disorder and not part of the autistic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bright Tots Rett description | url=http://www.brighttots.com/Rett_Syndrome.html | accessdate = July 30 | accessyear=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood disintegrative disorder===
[[Childhood disintegrative disorder]] (CDD, and sometimes abbreviated as CHDD also) is a very rare condition appearing in 3 or 4 year old children who have developed normally until age 2. Over several months, the child will deteriorate in intellectual, social, and language functioning from previously normal behaviour. This long period of normal development before regression helps differentiate CDD from Rett syndrome (and in fact it must be differentiated from autism in testing). The cause for CDD is unknown (thus it may be a spectrum disorder) but current evidence suggests it has something to do with the central nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Yale CDD description | url=http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/cdd.html | accessdate = July 30 | accessyear=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=NIH CDD description | url=http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001535.html | accessdate = July 30 | accessyear=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified===
[[PDD not otherwise specified|Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified]], or PDD-NOS, is referred to as a ''subthreshold'' condition because it is a classification which is given to someone who suffers from impairments in social interaction, communication, and/or stereotyped behaviour but does not meet the criteria for one of the other four pervasive developmental disorders. Unlike the other four pervasive developmental disorders, PDD-NOS has no specific guidelines for diagnosis, so the person may have a lot of characteristics of an autistic person, or few to none at all. Note that pervasive developmental disorder is not a diagnosis, just a term to refer to the five mentioned conditions, while PDD-NOS is an official diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PDD-NOS at Yale | url=http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/pddnos.html | accessdate = August 22 | accessyear=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albedo''' is a ratio of scattered to incident [[electromagnetic radiation]] power. It is a [[Dimensionless number|unitless]] measure of a surface or body's [[reflectivity]]. The word is derived from ''albus'', a [[Latin]] word for &quot;white&quot;.
[[Image:Albedo-e_hg.svg|thumb|Percentage of reflected sun light in relation to various surface conditions of the earth]]
The albedo is an important concept particularly in [[climatology]] and [[astronomy]]. In climatology it is sometimes expressed as a percentage. Its value depends on the [[frequency]] of radiation considered: unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of [[visible light]]. In general, the albedo depends on the direction and directional distribution of incoming radiation. An exception are  [[Lambertian]] surfaces, which scatter radiation equally in all directions, so their albedo does not depend on the incoming distribution. In realistic cases, a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF) is required to characterise the scattering properties of a surface accurately, although albedos are a very useful first approximation.

==Terrestrial albedo==
Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 90% for fresh snow, to about 4% for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. An exception are deeply shadowed cavities whose effective albedo may approach the zero of a [[blackbody]]. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, while desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms.  Most land areas are in an albedo range of 10 to 40% &lt;ref name=&quot;PhysicsWorld&quot;&gt;http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Albedo.html&lt;/ref&gt;.The average albedo of the [[Earth]] is about 30%. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

Human activities have changed the albedo (via forest clearance and farming, for example) of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect is difficult on the global scale: it is not clear whether the changes have tended to increase or decrease [[global warming]].

The classic example of albedo effect is the snow-temperature feedback . If a snow covered area warms and the snow melts, the albedo decreases, more sunlight is absorbed, and the temperature tends to increase. The converse is true: if snow forms, a cooling cycle happens. The intensity of the albedo effect depends on the size of the change in albedo and the amount of [[insolation]]; for this reason it can be potentially very large in the tropics.

The Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via [[Earth observation]] satellite sensors such as [[NASA]]'s [[MODIS]] instruments onboard the [[Terra]] and [[Aqua]] satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a [[mathematical model]] of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]].

===White-sky and black-sky albedo===
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular [[solar zenith angle]] &lt;math&gt;{\theta_i}&lt;/math&gt; can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the [[directional-hemispherical reflectance]] at that [[solar zenith angle]], &lt;math&gt;{\bar \alpha(\theta_i)}&lt;/math&gt;, and the [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]], &lt;math&gt;{\bar \bar \alpha}&lt;/math&gt; the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination &lt;math&gt;{D}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;p&gt;

Albedo &lt;math&gt;{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; can then be given as:&lt;p&gt;

&lt;math&gt;{\alpha}= (1-D) \bar \alpha(\theta_i) + D \bar \bar \alpha&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;

[[Directional-hemispherical reflectance]] is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and [[bi-hemispherical reflectance]] as white sky albedo, for obvious reasons. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from knowledge of intrinsic properties of the surface.

==Astronomical albedo==
The albedo of planets, satellites and asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (&quot;phase angle&quot;), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of [[photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about [[regolith]] properties, while unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metallic content in [[asteroid]]s.

[[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], a moon of Saturn, has the highest known albedo of any body in the solar system, with 99% of EM radiation reflected, while many objects in the outer solar system and [[asteroid belt]] have low albedos down to about 0.05. Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily [[space weathering|space weathered]] surface.

The overall albedo of the [[Moon]] is around 12%, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong [[opposition effect]].&lt;ref&gt;http://jeff.medkeff.com/astro/lunar/obs_tech/albedo.htm A discussion of Lunar albedos&lt;/ref&gt;  Such reflectance properties of moon [[regolith]] are different to those of any terrestrial terrains, but common on airless rocky solar system bodies.

Two common definitions of astronomical albedos are the [[geometric albedo]] and the [[Bond albedo]], and their values can differ significantly — a common source of confusion.

==Some examples of terrestrial albedo effects==
===Fairbanks, Alaska===
According to the [[National Climatic Data Center]]'s GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at [[Fairbanks, Alaska]], is about 3 °C (5 °F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of [[spruce]] [[tree]]s and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space. Neunke and Kukla have shown that this difference is especially marked during the late [[winter]] months, when [[solar radiation]] is greater.

===The tropics===
Although the albedo-temperature effect is most famous in colder regions of Earth, because more [[snow]] falls there, it is actually much stronger in tropical regions because in the tropics there is consistently more sunlight. When [[Brazil]]ian ranchers cut down dark, tropical [[rainforest]] trees to replace them with even darker soil in order to grow crops, the average temperature of the area appears to increase by an average of about 3 °C (5 °F) year-round, which is a significant amount.

===Small scale effects===
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. People who wear dark clothes in the summertime put themselves at a greater risk of [[heatstroke]] than those who wear white clothes.{{fact}}

===Pine forests===
The albedo of a [[pine]] forest at 45°N in the winter in which the trees cover the land surface completely is only about 9%, among the lowest of any naturally occurring land environment. This is partly due to the color of the pines, and partly due to multiple scattering of sunlight within the trees which lowers the overall reflected light level. Due to light penetration, the ocean's albedo is even lower at about 3.5%, though this depends strongly on the angle of the incident radiation. Dense [[swamp]]land averages between 9% and 14%. [[Deciduous tree]]s average about 13%. A [[grass]]y field usually comes in at about 20%. A barren field will depend on the color of the soil, and can be as low as 5% or as high as 40%, with 15% being about the average for farmland. A [[desert]] or large [[beach]] usually averages around 25% but varies depending on the color of the sand.&lt;ref&gt;[Edward Walker's study in the Great Plains in the winter around 45°N]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban areas===
Urban areas in particular have very unnatural values for albedo because of the many human-built structures which absorb light before the light can reach the surface. In the northern part of the world, cities are relatively dark, and Walker has shown that their average albedo is about 7%, with only a slight increase during the summer. In most tropical countries, cities average around 12%. This is similar to the values found in northern suburban transitional zones. Part of the reason for this is the different natural environment of cities in tropical regions, e.g., there are more very dark trees around; another reason is that portions of the tropics are very poor, and city buildings must be built with different materials. Warmer regions may also choose lighter colored building materials so the structures will remain cooler.

===Trees===
Because trees tend to have a low albedo, removing forests would tend to increase albedo and thereby cool the planet. [[Cloud feedback]]s further complicate the issue. In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily.

Studies by the [[Hadley Centre]] have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of [[carbon sequestration]] on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming [http://66.102.11.104/search?q=cache:o7LD-owSkNgJ:www.ulapland.fi/home/arktinen/feed_pdf/Betts_revised.pdf+hadley+albedo+forest&amp;hl=en].

===Snow===
Snow albedos can be as high as 90%. This is for the ideal example, however: fresh deep snow over a featureless landscape. Over [[Antarctica]] they average a little more than 80%.

If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt (the ice-albedo positive [[feedback]]). This is the basis for predictions of enhanced warming in the polar and seasonally snow covered regions as a result of [[global warming]].

===Clouds===
Clouds are another source of albedo that play into the global warming equation. Different types of clouds have different albedo values, theoretically ranging from a minimum of near 0% to a maximum in the high 70s.

Albedo and climate in some areas are already affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the [[contrail]]s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], after which all major airlines in the U.S. shut down for three days, showed a local 1 °C increase in the daily temperature range (the difference of day and night temperatures) (''see: [[contrail]]'').

===Aerosol effects===
[[Particulate|Aerosol]] (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) has two effects, direct and indirect. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as [[Cloud condensation nuclei|CCNs]] and thereby change [[cloud properties]]) is less certain [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/231.htm#671].

===Black carbon===
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the [[IPCC]] say that their &quot;estimate of the global mean radiative forcing for BC aerosols from fossil fuels is ... +0.2 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; (from +0.1 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; in the [[SAR (IPCC)|SAR]]) with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;. [http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/233.htm].

==References in popular culture==
===Video Games===
The Xenosaga series has an antagonist named Albedo, complete with white hair and characteristic traits that one in a state of Albedo would show.

===Literature===
In &quot;Hand of Chaos&quot; the fifth book in the Deathgate Cycle by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the Elven wizards known as Weesham (those whose task is to capture the [[soul]]s of royal Elves) are based out of an Albedo Cathedral.  In the series &quot;Albedo&quot; has come to denote the light of Elven souls reflecting back to their people.

===Music===
Greek musician [[Vangelis]] recorded an album called [[Albedo 0.39]], referring to average albedo of Earth.

'''Abu Dhabi''' ({{lang-ar|أبو ظبي}} ''ʼAbū Ẓaby'', literally &quot;Father of [[Gazelle]]&quot;) is the largest of the seven [[emirate]]s that compose the [[United Arab Emirates]] and was also the largest of the former [[Trucial States]]. '''Abu Dhabi''' is also a city of the same name within the Emirate that is the [[capital city|capital]] of the country, in north central UAE.  The city lies on a T-shaped island jutting into the [[Persian Gulf]] from the central western coast. An estimated 1,000,000 people lived there in 2000, with about an 80% [[expatriate]] population. Abu Dhabi city is located at {{coor d|24.4667|N|54.3667|E}}. The Emirate has approximately 70% of the country's entire wealth. [[Al Ain]] is Abu Dhabi's second largest urban area with a population of 348,000 (2003 census estimate) and is located 150 kilometres inland.



==Location==
[[Image:Abu dhabi.gif|thumb|Abu Dhabi is bordered by the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Oman]].]]
The emirate of Abu Dhabi is located in the oil-rich and strategic Persian Gulf region. It adjoins the Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[Sultanate of Oman]]. The emirate [[borders]] the emirate of [[Dubai]] to its north.

Abu Dhabi city is on an island located less than a quarter-kilometer from the mainland and is joined to the mainland by the Maqta and Musaffah Bridges.

==Language and literature==
The majority of the inhabitants of Abu Dhabi are expatriate workers and professionals from [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Egypt]], [[Philippines]], the [[United Kingdom]], and elsewhere.  [[English language|English]], [[Hindi]], [[Malayalam]], and [[Urdu]] are widely spoken.

The native-born population are [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking [[Gulf Arabs]] who are part of a clan-based society. The al-Nahyan family, part of the al-Falah branch of the Bani Yas tribe, rules the emirate and has a central place in society.

==Buildings and structures==
Abu Dhabi city is a modern city with broad boulevards, tall office and apartment buildings, and busy shops. Principal thoroughfares are The Corniche, Airport Road, Sheikh Zayed Street, Hamdan Street and Khalifa Street. Many streets are known for specialized businesses that tend to cluster on them. Hamdan Street is the main shopping street, Khalifa Street is lined with banks, Al Najdha Street is known for hardware stores, Defense St is filled with mobile telephone shops and Sheikh Zayed St (Also known as Electra Street) is the computer street.

Abu Dhabi city is known in the region for its greenery; the former desert strip today includes numerous parks and gardens. Key buildings include the [[Qasr al-Hosn]] (a.k.a. Old Fort or White Fort), Clock Tower (now demolished due to construction of the new Corniche), headquarters of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and its many operating-company subsiduaries and the Cultural Foundation. The Corniche, which was re-developed in 2005, is now one of the best sea front parks in the Gulf.

The current developments in Abu Dhabi, like its neighbour [[Dubai]], reflect a number of architectural masterpieces by, among others, [[Zaha Hadid]] and [[Frank Gehry]].

Other urban centers in the Abu Dhabi emirate are [[Al 'Ain]] and [[Ruwais]]. Al Ain is an agglomeration of several villages scattered around a valuable desert oasis; today it is the site of the national university, UAEU. Al Ain is billed as the Garden City of the UAE. Other work includes the 1st prize international competition of the Abu Dhabi Library and Cultural Center won by the Architects Collaborative, designed by [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]] of Boston, Massachusetts and New York, NY.

==Current ruler==
His Highness [[Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahayan|Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahayan]] is the hereditary [[emir]] and ruler of Abu Dhabi, as well as the current president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

==Postage stamps==

==Climate==
Sunny/blue skies can be expected throughout the year. The months June through September are generally hot and humid with temperatures averaging above 40ºC (110ºF). During this time, sandstorms also occur intermittently, in some cases reducing visibility down to a few meters. The weather is usually pleasant from October to May. January to February is cooler and may require the use of a light jacket. This period also sees dense fog on some days. The oasis city of [[Al Ain]], about 150 km away, bordering Oman, regularly records the highest summer temperatures in the country, however the dry desert air and cooler evenings make it a traditional retreat from the intense summer heat and year round humidity of the capital city.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]], [http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT002910 Average weather] for [[Sharjah]], which is 170 kilometres away from Abu Dhabi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[Abu Dhabi International Airport]]- (AUH) serves this city. The local time is [[GMT]] + 4 hours. Private vehicles and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city, although public buses, run by the Abu Dhabi Muncipality, are available, but mostly used by the lower-income population. There are bus routes to nearby towns such as Baniyas, Habashan and the garden city of UAE [[Al Ain]], among others. There is a newer service started in 2005 between Abu Dhabi and the commercial city of Dubai (about 160 km away)

==City Planning==
The city was planned in the 1970s (all that remains of the previous settlement is [[Al Hosn Fort]]) for an estimated maximum population of 600,000. In accordance with what was considered to be ideal urban planning at the time, the city has wide grid-pattern roads, and high-density tower blocks.

On the northerly end of the island, where the population density is highest, the main streets are lined with 20-story towers. Inside this rectangle of towers is a normal grid pattern of roads with lower density buildings (2 storey villas or 6 storey low-rise buildings).

Away from the high-density areas, land is primarily used for government buildings and private villas.

Mail is delivered to post-office boxes only; there is no door-to-door delivery.
There are many parks (or 'public gardens') throughout the city. Entrance is usually free for children, however there is often an entry fee for adults.

==Planning Problems==
* The city's population far surpasses the original estimated maximum population when it was designed. This causes traffic congestion, a shortage of car parking spaces, and over crowding.
* Having Post Office mail delivery only, and no widely-usable address system thus far for buildings, causes problems in describing building locations. This means directions must often be given based on nearby landmarks.
* The lack of a comprehensive, reliable, and frequent public transport system has led to a near complete dependence on private cars as a means of transport.
* Grid-pattern roads mean a public transportation system is difficult to implement without requiring a moderate amount of walking, which would be a large deterrent to usage.
* Closely positioned, high-rise towers often means accommodation is dark and claustrophobic.

==Future Development==
* The city's exhibition centre ([[ADNEC]]) is currently experiencing huge development.
* A metro, and improved bus services are planned to resolve traffic problems.
* [[Parking meter]]s are currently being tried out as a solution to parking problems.

New developments on islands surrounding the city plan to increase the population of the city by up to 800,000.

====Major Projects Under Construction====
* [[Saadiyat Island]] ('Island of Happiness')
* [[Al Lulu Island]]
* [[Reem Island]]
* [[Al Raha]]



==Culture and the Arts==

Abu Dhabi is home to a number of cultural institutions including the [[Cultural Foundation]] and the [[National Theater]]. The Cultural foundation is home to the [[UAE Public Library and Cultural Center]]. Various cultural societies such as the Abu Dhabi Classical Music Society have a strong and visible following in the city.

* Progress on the creation of a major &quot;up-scale cultural district&quot; on Abu Dhabi's [[Saadiyat Island]] has begun with the groundwork for a $400 million [[Guggenheim Museum]].

* The [[Frank Gehry]] designed museum will display a &quot;prestige collection&quot; of modernist and contemporary art and is scheduled for completion in 2011. Upon completion, it is expected to be the largest exponent of the prestigious [[Guggenheim Museums]].

* The island development will also include museums for classical art and performing arts centers among other state-of-the-art cultural facilities.

* $28 Billion has been set aside to budget this cultural development.

==Trivia==
* The city of Abu Dhabi, and the majority of UAE, has a large number of stray cats. The cartoon cat [[Garfield]] would often put the kitten [[Nermal]] in a box and ship him to Abu Dhabi. The phrase &quot;Abu Dhabi is where all the cute kittens go&quot; is sometimes used in the comic.
* An Abu Dhabi market place was featured in the children's television show [[Muppet Babies]].

== Jenkins review ==

I've eliminated the Jenkins review piece, as it contains several factual errors, such as repeating the rumor that Rand got her name from her typewriter. [[User:LaszloWalrus|LaszloWalrus]] 10:34, 23 June 2006 (UTC)
:There were no errors in the parts cited, and you have no proof there were errors to begin with. This is just a POV deletion as usual, which I am reverting. Try coming up with a strong argument for once. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 13:41, 23 June 2006 (UTC)

== Huffington and Bloom ==

I have eliminated the Huffington's criticism; it is a passing comment on a relatively minor aspect of the novel. CEO's don't act like the characters in Atlas Shrugged? Peers of England don't act like Gwynplaine in [[The Man Who Laughs]] either. The elimination of the [[Harold Bloom]] comment seems to be a concerted effort to eliminate anything at all flattering to Atlas Shrugged. Bloom is probably the most respected literary critic today, so this seems strange. [[User:LaszloWalrus|LaszloWalrus]] 11:47, 24 June 2006 (UTC)

Bloom's statement was not cited. An we've been over Huffington's argument already, and it stays. You argument against her is nothing new, so it is not going to change things. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 00:03, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
:We went over the Huffington article and you were unable to provide any good reason why it should stay. —[[User:Centrx|Centrx]]→[[User talk:Centrx|''talk'']]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull; 01:07, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
::I gave plenty of good reasons. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 02:59, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

I'd like to point out to Neverborn that the source was not there when I deleted the Bloom line. If a source was given, it wouldn't have been deleted. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 03:01, 25 June 2006 (UTC)

== This was not Rand's position ==

This line is not correct: &quot;Rand herself wrote that the separation of fiction and serious philosophical ideas is absurd, because art is the representation of philosophical judgments.&quot; This was simply not Rand's position. Art according to Rand, did have SOME philosophical conetent, but not necessarily &quot;serious philosophical ideas.&quot; [[User:LaszloWalrus|LaszloWalrus]] 03:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC)



==Jewish==

The last time I added the fact she was Jewish to this article, a user reverted with this statement, &quot;{she didn't identify as Jewish and even swiched to a non-&quot;Jewish-sounding&quot; name)&quot;

I changed it back, indicating that she was, in fact, a Jew. The way the article read before (Russian-born writer) one might be under the impression that she was of Russian blood. But clearly, any researcher on this subject knows that she was Jewish and many of her friends were Jewish as well. I added the 'jew factor' in because I did not want any misunderstandings in the article, and I think we should celebrate her diversity.

*This user's only other edit today was an anti-semitic personal attack on the Userpage of [[User:Khoikhoi]] which has been reverted. I am reverting this edit as well. --[[User:Doc Tropics|Doc Tropics]] 03:32, 30 June 2006 (UTC)


actually, she may have been jewish born (she was) but she was an athiest. And to this comment:  &quot;and I think we should celebrate her diversity.&quot; would have offended her. I think anyone that has read any of her work, like her or not would agree with that.

==South Park==
Centrix recently deleted a line about a South Park episode that mentions AS. If we can add a bit more info about it, I think it would be ok to have it in the article. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 22:39, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

==Modern Library paragraph censored==
I'm not entirely against the changes made to the Modern Library section, but one line didn't need to be removed. The line in which Ray Jenkins claims that &quot;Rand's unwillingness to cut the size of the book was a sign of [[megalomania]]&quot; was sourced, yet it deleted without explaination. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 23:26, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

:That quote is more about Ayn Rand than about ''Atlas Shrugged''. The poll is directly relevant and Jenkins gives one possible explanation of it (&quot;great American cult&quot;)—though even that is a little attenuated—and the other commentary about her works being deplored by critics and the length of the speech is directly related to the book. Directly relevant information would be that the book is long and that she refused to cut it down, with critics saying it is loose and could have been refined. The criticism is already too loosely connected as it is; it is turning into a list of every newspaper article, etc. that has ever been published about the book. —[[User:Centrx|Centrx]]→[[User talk:Centrx|''talk'']]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull; 23:55, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

== News on the movie ==

Here's some info for the movie section: [http://www.lfb.com/index.php?action=help&amp;helpfile=july06archive.html#071306]

With this much info, is it already time to to grant it its own article? - [[User:Stormwatch|Stormwatch]] 02:37, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

:I don't know if that counts as a reliable source; we'd be able to find more sources with this info if it was right. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 03:31, 23 July 2006 (UTC)

::Here's more info: [http://www.objectivistcenter.org/cth-13-1741-Summer_Seminar_Atlas_Shrugged_film.aspx], [http://bidinotto.journalspace.com/?cmd=displaycomments&amp;dcid=416&amp;entryid=416] - [[User:Stormwatch|Stormwatch]] 18:00, 29 July 2006 (UTC)

== Rethinking the Huffington quote ==

I read the above discussion about Huffington's criticism, and I'm having a hard time understanding why it's the ''anti''-Rand people who want to keep it in.  The Huffington quote basically reveals she didn't actually read past about chapter two.  Therefore, even with the caveat that she's wrong in that statement, it basically gives the impression that critics of ''Atlas Shrugged'' have to resort to uninformed, and erroneous statements in order to find something wrong with it.  When that is listed as a prominent criticism, it makes the reader wonder if there even is a non-clueless criticism of the book.  If I were trying to put Rand in the best light possible, I would probably want to include only the most ridiculous criticisms, and this one qualifies.  So, if your goal is perhaps to make sure the anti-Rand views are best expressed, I really have to question if that goal is achieved by inclusion of Huffington's criticism. [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 14:45, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

:Why is it that every time a Randist criticizes their critics they always claim that the critic is stupid or didn't read the book? Can't you actually refute the argument instead of resorting to illogical ad hominem attacks? If Randism is logical, please try to give an actual logical rebuttal. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 15:05, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

::Assuming you're being serious, the rebuttal is given in the article: ''Atlas Shrugged'' has numerous CEO's who demanded government intervention in their favor, so it makes no sense to claim that AS portrays CEO's in general as anti-government intervention.  It portrays anti-intervention CEO's as good, and pro-intervention CEO's as bad.  Again, if I were trying to promote Rand, I would *love* to include the Huffington to quote in order or portray all criticism as stemming merely from being misinformed.  What I don't understand is why ''you'' want critics to look stupid. If you're okay with that, so am I. [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 16:04, 25 July 2006 (UTC)
:::Huffington is speaking about CEOs in general and the Enron executives in particular and comparing them to Rand's ideal businessman; that's not to say Huffington is unaware that not every businessman in ''AS'' meets Rand's ideal. What sounds ignorant in that paragraph is the attempted refutation, &quot;However, Rand does show examples of businessmen who act in such a manner i.e. Orren Boyle, Jim Taggart&quot;, since Huffington never claimed Rand didn't show such examples. It's clear Boyle and Taggart aren't Rand's ideal businessman, so they're irrelevant to Huffington's comments. That said, however, I don't know how appropriate a discussion of Huffington's article is in the &quot;Critical reception&quot; section, since she isn't actually criticizing ''AS'' in it, she's criticizing American businessmen for not living up to the Randian ideal. At worst, she's indirectly criticizing the Randian ideal for being unrealistic, but she doesn't come out and say that. I'm also not convinced the South Park reference belongs in &quot;Critical reception&quot;, since it's really just a throw-away joke that is almost certainly more about the length and &quot;heavy slogging&quot; of the book than its philosophical content: [[South Park Republican]]ism is, after all, very close to Randian Objectivism, with perhaps a little less misanthropy. [[User:Angr]] 17:39, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
::::Then shouldn't we remove the Huffington bit?  I don't see how it's notable as criticism of the AS.  I read the whole piece and I still don't see it.  It's not that I want to suppress criticism.  I'm worried about the soft bias of putting in only the weakest or most tangential criticisms so as to make it appear no one has serious arguments against it. [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 20:07, 8 August 2006 (UTC)
:::::You do know that you could add more criticisms to the section yourself. I know they are hard to find (Rand, being merely a romance novelist with a implicitly fascist attitude, doesn't get that many reviews from respectable reviewers), but you could put the effort into it yourself rather than tell the rest of us to look up more content for you. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 05:03, 9 August 2006 (UTC)
::::::Good thing I didn't, that would have sucked. [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 16:21, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

==Neutrality of Criticism Section==
All of the entries here are cited and fairly reported, reasonable readers are aware that criticism is pov by definition.
--[[User:Son of Somebody|Son of Somebody]] 23:22, 25 July 2006 (UTC)

: If they are cited and fairly reported, then their placement is probably, but not necessarily, consistent with [[WP:NPOV]].  The issue isn't about whether the criticism itself violates WP:NPOV, but whether its placement does.  And good criticism, by the way, is not necessarily in violation of WP:NPOV.  One can fairly and objectively criticize a movie, Hitler, Nixon, a philosophy... ''anything''.  Anyway, I reverted the tag because the comment only cited the &quot;criticism&quot; card - as if a criticism section is not subject to the rules of [[WP:NPOV]].  That's false.  At the same time, anyone who puts the tag in there, should explain the reasons for doing so.  --[[User:Serge Issakov|Serge]] 00:01, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

::Many works of art on Wikipedia have sections dealing with critical reception, surely this work of literature is important enough that it also merits such a section.  Or perhaps none of the others merit a section, as even the best of them violates [[WP:NPOV]].  This section is not presented in a manner that implies that the Wiki authors are inserting their personal views.  In any event, this tag was not explained and this is the first discussion about it.  If criticism sections are subject to [[WP:NPOV]], someone has a lot of deleting to do.--[[User:Son of Somebody|Son of Somebody]] 01:17, 26 July 2006 (UTC)

Why is the Modern Library poll said to be &quot;notorious&quot;?[[User:Agent Cooper|Agent Cooper]] 16:16, 9 August 2006 (UTC)

I've removed some of the content in the criticism section. Having contextless opinions like &quot;people read the novel for the fornicating bits&quot; or the novel reads like &quot;a novelization of Mein Kampf by Barbara Cartland&quot; is pointless. It is akin to saying &quot;in the opinion of {some reviewer} Atlas Shrugged sucks.&quot; I have left the more substansive reviews, positive or negative, that actually say something about the novel (right or wrong). Similarly, the South Park anecdote belongs at most to a trivia section, not a criticism section. [[User:LaszloWalrus|LaszloWalrus]] 08:05, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:You don't get to choose who reviews the book. Once again, you've made a POV edit, serving no purpose other than to censor Rand's critics. It would help a lot more if you could make some form of edit that wasn't based in bias. Try adding something constructive, something that doesn't violating any policy; for once we might not have to revert you. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 15:31, 14 August 2006 (UTC)
::LGagnon, I'm not sure you understand how the criticism section looks to an outsider. Let's say I'm neutral.  Let's say I just read the book.  Then I come to Wikipedia to look for the criticisms.  Then I see:
:::Reviewer X said it's like Mein Kampf.
:::Reviewer Y said people like to read the dirty parts.
:::Reviewer Z said a South Park episode joked about the length.
:::Reviewer Z1 said that a lot of people are like the jerks in the book.
::What conclusion would I draw?  Most people, seeing those criticisms dominate the criticism section, would think, &quot;Hey, no one can offer a really substantial criticism.  Maybe no one has any substantive objection to the book's theme.  Maybe Rand is on to something.&quot;  That's why I have a hard time understanding why people who don't like AS want those criticisms in.  It's like they ''want'' to prod people into having a high opinion of it.  Understand where I'm coming from? [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 17:13, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:::That's an utterly illogical conclusion. Rand might be on to something if you don't agree with the critics? There are a lot of bad criticisms of the nazis, but they aren't on to something, and nobody is going to make that assumption about them. Sorry, but I don't understand where you're coming from, because you aren't using logic to explain your opinion.
:::If you have a problem with the criticisms, that's tough. We're supposed to represent all major opinions, not just those that are Randist-approved. I'll admit we don't have enough reviews, but then again even the person who complains loudest about this (you) hasn't added more. I'm sorry but you are not going to change the article around just by throwing around weak illogical rhetoric for the sake of deleting criticisms of Rand's work. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 18:12, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:::::::I don't think you understand me. I'm not making a bad faith claim; I'm simply stating the fact that your &quot;argument&quot; lacks logic, and thus does not warrant a response until you can create a logical argument.

Just come up with something that follows actual logic and then you can have your response. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 00:32, 15 August 2006 (UTC)
:::::::: No, I'll give a serious response. Reading these talk pages, it's becoming difficult to assume good faith when it comes to LGagnon, and I do think some real criticisms (surely they exist?) need to replace the hodge-podge of amatuerish research that is in the article now. I don't have the time to hunt them down now, and may not ever, so in the meantime they should probably stay (after all, Wikipolicy is to use verified sources, not simply subjectively &quot;high quality&quot; sources).

Alright, you win.  I'll play your game.  In response to what you said (your statements in italics):
:''Rand might be on to something if you don't agree with the critics?''
No.  Had you read what I posted, you would have noticed that the claim was that the article induces the reader to think &quot;if the best criticisms of the book only cover superficial issues, maybe no one has a substantive objection, and thus, Rand's at least right about something&quot;.
:''If you have a problem with the criticisms, that's tough. We're supposed to represent all major opinions, not just those that are Randist-approved.''
Had you read what I posted, you would have noticed that a criticism not being &quot;Randist-approved&quot; was not the basis for my questioning its presence in the article.  You would have instead noticed that my point was that, far from showing reasons to doubt the arguments advanced by the book, it would reinforce people's support of it -- '''make them more supportive of Rand's beliefs''' -- by making it look like critics are only capable of superficial responses  that dodge the main point.  You would have noticed my warning you that Rand would have gladly approved of these &quot;criticisms&quot; dominating article, and you would have realized how foolish it would sound to act like I was trying to get only Rand-approved criticisms.
:''I'll admit we don't have enough reviews, but then again even the person who complains loudest about this (you) hasn't added more.''
Yes, because I admit that the scholarly debates over the merit of AS is not my area of expertise and my time would be better spent working on articles on topics I'm already familiar with.
:''I'm sorry but you are not going to change the article around just by throwing around weak illogical rhetoric for the sake of deleting criticisms of Rand's work.''
See above on the &quot;illogical rhetoric&quot; bit.  I would also like to introduce you to the fact that a problem can only be solved by first identifying that it exists, and that my input was indeed a vital step in remedying a deficiency in this article.&lt;br&gt;Now that I have carefully explained my position for a third time, I'm sure that you won't accidentally misinterpret it in the future in a way that appears to be trolling but I can't assume is trolling because I am assuming good faith in all Wikipedians, against all evidence ot the contrary.

::I won't debate that literature isn't your area of expertise, but that shouldn't hold you off from simple research. Even if all you did was post a few links to reviews on this talk page, you'd still have put more effort into improving the criticism section than you have done with simply complaining about it. It doesn't take a college degree to look up reviews.
::And again, you are simply giving your opinion that these reviews are superficial. There are some very well detailed ones (Huffington, for instance, gave an analysis quite similar to academic papers I've read) which you are calling superficial without giving any real analysis of their work to prove your point. Instead, you set up a strawman by minimizing their claims to something poorly thought out (i.e. reducing Huffington's analysis to &quot;a lot of people are like the jerks in the book&quot; rather than taking on her actual analysis). Your claims have simply come off as fallicious opinion, not logical fact, and thus I still don't see a need to remove these criticisms. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 16:46, 15 August 2006 (UTC)

I expect I'll be stepping on some toes by jumping in on this issue but hopefully I can offer a fresh perspective on a couple of issues. I'm going to leave the more difficult parts for you guys to continue to fight over, but two of the disputed pieces seem very simple to me. First, the quote by [[Russell Kirk]] is a complaint about the readers of atlas shrugged and not the book itself. It seems to me that even if we assume it's true, Ayn Rand herself might notice it and make the same complaint, that doesn't mean she'd be complaining about her own novel. Secondly about the southpark reference; I have no qualms with it being in the article, but to consider it a critical commentary seems strange. Southpark is rife with nonsequitors, sarcasm and absurdities. Even if it weren't the writers of southpark are hardly a reliable source of literary insight. And as mentioned above, it's not even clear that the writers were trying to comment on it's content; it seems possible if not likely that a person just overcoming illiteracy would simply be afraid to reread a book with large words and small text.[[User:Vicarious|Vicarious]] 06:02, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

At the risk of muddying the waters, I would think that those friendly to Objectivism would want to have all these silly quotes in, because they are almost all by people with a political agenda and come off as ideological. It would be far more damaging if someone could find a reputable literary critic who has something negative to say about the work as literature. Of course you can't, because you can barely find a reputable literary critic who has anything to say about it at all. In fact, the only literary analysis I've been able to find at all in a normal venue without a political agenda classifies Rand's fiction as adolescent-interest cult fiction, and puts it in the not too shabby company of such writers as Hermann Hesse. BTW, I think that there should be a category tag &quot;Cult Fiction&quot; but I'm too newbie to know how to do it. Lastly, I think I speak for all sane people everywhere in asking that the edit warring just stop. Where does it get anyone? Will it degenerate into a discussion of who started it?

One of the problems as I see it is that many of the people who strongly criticise the book are actually responding to Rand's politics, and not to the book as a book: though obviously with such a politicised book it's somewhat hard to seperate the two.

I would agree, though, that the article should be primarily about 'Atlas Shrugged' as a book, not as a political philosophy: the problem, as I mentioned below, is that it's a lousy book once you take out the philosophy. I also noticed that someone renamed 'Critical reception' to 'Reception' apparently to justify including that quote, which seems equally childish to me.

== philosopher ==

LGagnon may disagree strongly with Objectivism, but for him to make ridiculous POV edits that eliminate any mention of Ayn Rand as a philosopher is simply outrageous. Perhaps he should check sources such as Britannica that explicitly refer to her as a philosopher. I hate the music of modern bands, but I'm not going to go to their articles and eliminate any statement referring to them as &quot;music bands.&quot; Adam T.

:I don't know how long you've been at Wikipedia, but it's been proven that Britannica is not a completely reliable source, even failing to be as reliable as Wikipedia itself. Likewise, Britannica is not a more reliable source than academia (especially given the fact that Wikipedia can outdo them), and few sources are more reliable than academia. Thus, I don't see how Britannica's opinion beats out the collective opinion of the most important source of knowledge in the world. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 19:13, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

I was unaware that omniscience was humanly attainable. [[User:Unigolyn|Unigolyn]] 09:38, 7 September 2006 (UTC)

I don't much like any of this discussion on either side. One can characterize any novel that has ideas in it as &quot;philosophical&quot; or &quot;ideological&quot; depending upon one's biases, and certain perfectly respectable literary figures will inspire these kinds of reactions (Dostoevski, for example, whose ideas strike an awful lot of people as both nasty in content and poorly argued but beautifully presented). This should not be a pro-Objectivist/anti-Objectivist issue. I would urge you all to regard whatever authority &quot;academia&quot; has in ''this'' context, in ''this'' article, to be regarding how to approach AS as literature, not as philosophy. I've already suggested that there is so little discussion of that sort that there's not much one can say; one literary critic (as opposed to political columnist/activist) characterized it as &quot;adolescent reader cult fiction&quot; which seems much more apt to me than &quot;dangerous right-wing ideologue&quot; or &quot;profound philosophical thinker&quot; if we're talking about the ''fiction''. If a Comp Lit department had a class on Dostoevski, no one would get terribly agitated if ''Bros K'' was referred to as &quot;a philosophical novel&quot; and I really doubt that Saul Kripke would pick up the phone and complain about trademark infringment. This is just the wrong way to think about this whole issue. I wish both sides would climb down and listen to reason.[[User:Agent Cooper|Agent Cooper]] 22:48, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

: The problem is that Rand is a horribly bad writer: I don't think anyone would sit through a thousand-page Rand novel were it not for the philosophy. Personally I'd say 'Atlas Shrugged' deserves a place in the hundred most important novels of the 20th century, but as a novel, rather than fictionalised philosophy, it's just awful... and I think that discrepancy is where a large part of the problem with the article stems from. [[User:Mark Grant|Mark Grant]] 00:38, 20 August 2006 (UTC)

== Ongoing Problems ==

I'm getting testy...

&quot;''Atlas Shrugged'' is a novel by Russian-born writer and philosopher Ayn Rand,&quot;

This is fine. She called herself a philosopher for twenty years, and there have been 2-3 books by academic philosophers about her as a philosopher (Chris Sciabarra, Tara Smith and the collection of essays for Univ. Illinois Press). ''Introduction to the Objectivist Epistemology'' may be wrong, it may even be crap, but if so, it is philosophical crap. Philosopher is not necessarily a term of endearment.

&quot;It was Rand's last work of fiction before concentrating her writings exclusively on philosophy.&quot;

I think this should read &quot;exclusively on philosophy, politics and cultural criticism.&quot; Essays on patent and copyright law would ordinarily be characterized as politics. Essays on Apollo 11 and Marilyn Monroe would ordinarily be classified as cultural criticism.

&quot;It is a highly philosophical&quot;

as opposed to lowly philosophical? This is just junk writing. It's so-o-o-o-o philosophical. Let it go.

&quot;and allegorical story&quot;

Strictly speaking, no, it’s not really allegory at all. An allegory is where the lion stands for courage, the scarecrow stands for intelligence, etc. It is not an allegory when the corrupt business man stands for corrupt businessmen. It's about what it's about, not something else. That not only tallies with Rand's self-understanding, but standard literary nomenclature. So we can let the whole sentence go, since it says nothing, and says it badly.

&quot;that deals with themes of Rand's own Objectivism&quot;

This is anachronistic. Rand did not announce herself as a philosopher nor use the expression &quot;Objectivism&quot; until after the novel was published. One could more accurately describe &quot;Objectivism&quot; as the distillation and extension of ideas explored in ''Atlas Shrugged''. According to her journals, this began as a literary scenario. Her one attempt at a philosophical essay (&quot;Moral Basis of Individualism&quot;) that predates it went unpublished.

&quot;though she was not yet known as a philosopher when it was written.&quot;

Nor did she refer to herself in those terms publicly at that time or previously. The whole sentence has to be revised. See above.

&quot;''Atlas Shrugged'' is an extremely political book.&quot;

Extremely? This is junk writing. It's like totally not cool to like totally refer to her like politics as like extremely political. Apart from being just awful writing, it also has unconscious connotations, by causing the mind to glide the term &quot;extremism.&quot; Something like &quot;laden with political content&quot; or even &quot;heavily politicized&quot; is better, though the latter is probably POV-problematic.

&quot;In rejecting the traditional Christian altruistic moral code, Rand also rejects the sexual code that, in her view, is a logical implication of altruism.&quot;

Doesn’t she deliberately characterize this as broader than Christianity, and deliberately avoid naming Christianity explicitly? In fact, my recollection is that the only characters who are meant to be associated with anything specifically religious are linked to unnamed generic Asian thought. And isn't it merely Rand's opinion that real-world Christianity is as she characterizes this unlabeled code (in a spirit of 'if the shoe fits')? If you think it through, this is subtle POV. Norman O. Brown said that Christianity is all about ecstatic body affirmation. He was a loon of course, but are we supposed to take sides here?

I'm reluctant to just start fixing things in light of the edit-warring going on, since I don't want to waste my time sending data into the void, but if there are no objections to my comments above, after a week or so, I'll make changes reflecting them. [[User:Agent Cooper|Agent Cooper]] 23:21, 16 August 2006 (UTC)

== &quot;How long was it?&quot; ==

[For those who are under 50, that's an allusion to Johnny Carson]. Well, I see that others started the process and I dived in too. It looks better. I was wondering what people thought about the &quot;longest book&quot; thing. First of all, I think the long books page is a really silly idea; books that run tens of thousands of pages are noteworthy, but I really don't think that novels in the thousand page range are that unusual--if we could drum them all up and it turned out there were hundreds of them, would that mean that there were hundreds of &quot;among the longest book ever written&quot;? There is a factual dimension to this: most people who read or try to read the book are struck by its length, and some find it just too long. But I'm not sure what the point of this comment is. I think that it is meaningful to mention its page count (1168 in the hardcover first edition) so that people can respond to that, but this sentence almost makes it sound like it's an achievement or a crime, and it's really neither here nor there (without more--it is a very common private reponse that it is way too long, but there's no way to articulate that here). [[User:Agent Cooper|Agent Cooper]] 13:50, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

:It's both useful and arbitrary. It's arbitrary in that it doesn't really have a unique size; my copy of Don DeLillo's &quot;Underworld&quot; is just as big, and plenty of books by Neal Stephenson and Stephen King fit in that size range as well. On the other hand, AS's size is something that it is often criticized for, as even diehard fans find it to be bloated. I think the &quot;longest books&quot; statement should go, as it's both poorly researched and potently a peacock statement. However, the article should mention something about the problem people have with its size (which I think it does already). -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 16:15, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

Check my attempt and tell me if this is better--I thought a reference to the length made more sense in the &quot;magnum opus&quot; sentence. [[User:Agent Cooper|Agent Cooper]] 17:34, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

== Literary elements going completely undiscussed in article on work of literature ==

For an article on a piece of fiction, there's a near complete absence of any discussion of imagery, symbolism or style. Is this because any material, since it wouldn't be sourceable beyond AS itself, would constitute &quot;original research&quot;? Or is it because no one has the odd combination of knowledge and skill to pull it off? I was thinking about this in connection with the recurring &quot;Atlantis&quot; trope (which was inspired by Isabel Paterson's characterization of America as Atlantis in ''God of the Machine''--about 95% of Rand's thought is the natural outgrowth of a three-way collision between Nietzsche, Dostoevski and Isabel Paterson--though ''Anthem'' also owes a huge debt to Zamyatin). Can anything be done about this, or is it off-limits? It wouldn't seem to be, since discussion of plot and character seems to be in a sense original research as well. Also, Rand wrote quite a bit about her artistic intentions (in ''Romantic Manifesto''), which is relevant here as well (she talks about her attempt to recreate certain elements of Dostoevski's technique, for example, which would seem very relevant to discussing the novel as novel, why it has the peculiar qualities it does, given her Russian background and conscious intentions--in a sense, AS is meant to be a sort of American ''The Possessed'', and would seem a lot less odd if it had a Russian ''sounding'' author's name and a Russian setting). Since I am pushing the line that AS is just another book with recognizable features if one classifies it as adolescent-interest cult fiction, written by a Russian-American author influenced by the 19th century Russian novel, it would be nice if there was some trace of understanding of how this peculiar confection works, rather than just paean and denunciation. A big part of the problematic reception of this work is that there was no reception community in place for any sort of ''19th century Russian novel'' about ''what's wrong with the New Deal''! How could there be? The very idea is bizarre. [Note: before anyone jumps all over me about the tag &quot;cult fiction&quot; I should stress that this term has no relationship to the &quot;cult accusation&quot; issue--it means a literary work that plays a disproportionate role in its reader's literary experience, a &quot;beloved&quot; book, like ''Dune'' or ''Lord of the Rings''. That characterization seems to me exactly right.] [[User:Agent Cooper|Agent Cooper]] 17:34, 17 August 2006 (UTC)

:This is a pretty hard thing to get done. While the article should contain literary analysis, academia doesn't really care enough about Rand to analyze her work. Thus, we don't really have anything to work with. I'd assume it'd be the same way with L Ron Hubbard or any other author who scared away academia with cult psychobabble and lawsuit threats.
:As someone who does a lot of work with an academic literary department, I don't really see any chance that Rand would get serious coverage by academia in the future. Honestly, her work reads like pulp romance novels and leans very heavily into Mein Kampf/The Turner Diaries territory. Stuff like that will at the very least slow academia's acceptance of her down, if not stop it from ever happening.
:Still, we could use info from reviews and whatever Rand had to say about her work. I'm reluctant to let her have the final say on it, though. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 00:26, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

== Not a criticism... ==

Since I'm not contributing to the article I have no room to criticize, so consider the following mere observation:

----

I've been intently following this article now for a year or so, trying to make out just exactly what forces are at work. There's obviously two opposing camps. Every so often, one camp or the other will come in and shift things around so that the article slants more this way or that. Then there's wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then someone else comes in and the whole process starts over again. I guess this is how it's all designed to work—Wikipedia, I mean—but it's really not...working, that is. The article on ''Atlas Shrugged'' has become for me the test case for Wikipedia. I'm waiting to see happen what I can only assume is supposed to happen: the appearance of an insightful, unbiased and ''coherent'' article. Brevity would a plus too.

Ultimately I think that Wikipedia is not for the self-gratification of those writing the articles. These articles are—again I'm assuming—for a person seeking out information. (Let's imagine a young person just becoming interested in literature, curious about a book that their friend recommended.) If I were that young person, which I was, I would want to know a few key pieces of information and I would want this information presented in as organized and proficient a manner as possible. They would include:

*1) What it is. (A novel.) When it was written and by whom. &lt;sub&gt;(Who? I never get that right.)&lt;/sub&gt;

*2) What those who like it like about it, preferably in a short paragraph or two.

*3) What those who don't like it don't like about it...again, keeping it short.

...and...

*4) Where, if I'm interested, I could seek out further (still insightful, unbiased and coherent) information.

This for me would be the bare minimum I would expect to see in an authoritative source. Lacking these few items, I just wouldn't trust it.

MDMullins

&lt;sub&gt;(Lost my login, along with my wide-eyed innocence, long ago.)&lt;/sub&gt;

I'm not in either &quot;camp&quot; and I've been trying to make incremental improvements that are acceptable to a consensus since I've been here. Almost everything I've written has stayed in. So it can be done. [[User:Agent Cooper|Agent Cooper]] 05:03, 5 September 2006 (UTC)

== Definition of philosopher ==

My two cents here would be that the attempt to label Rand as a pseudophilosopher for purposes of NPOV should win the Contrivance of the Year award. Since when is &quot;philosopher&quot; the only calling which excludes autodidacts? While it's obvious that mere self-proclamation doesn't make you one according to general consensus, merely lacking a formal degree in philosophy and/or being a &quot;bad&quot; philosopher doesn't make one a pseudo-anything. The word &quot;philosopher&quot; isn't limited to academic philosophers, anymore than the word &quot;pianist&quot; demands attendance of a conservatory. While every academic philosopher I've met considers Rand's philosophical work deeply flawed, the body of her work in the field is expansive and well-known enough. Heck, if I decided to become a brain surgeon with no formal education in the field, and actually managed to perform brain surgery on a reasonable amount of people without being thrown in jail or killing every one of them, I think I'd warrant being called a brain surgeon.

:Unigolyn, you miss my point. It's not just the fact that she's outside of academia; it's also that she simply never developed the talent to be acceptable by anyone with a decent education. Honestly, look at her citations for her anti-Kant argument; in most cases, she uses strawmen against some guy who she trhinks is pro-Kant, and in the one case where she tries to cite Kant it's &quot;see the works of Hegel and Kant&quot;. You can't honestly tell me someone with an education worthy of note wrote that utterly stupid line. It's not even a real citation, and if you don't believe me, I'm citing the location of that line as &quot;see the works of Ayn Rand&quot;. She doesn't do philosophy; see does weasely arguments for what she thinks is right without real research into the topic (something she apparently didn't believe in). -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 19:57, 7 September 2006 (UTC)
::Someone being &quot;stupid&quot; in your eyes is not a disqualification for being a philospher.  Neither is being wrong.  Neither is being sloppy.  People say these things about all kinds of &quot;true&quot; philosophers.  Just give it up dude.  No one's going to &quot;convert&quot; to objectivism because Wikipedia follows the encyclopedic practice of calling her a philosopher.  I just don't see what your problem is.

:::First of all, part of her appeal is that she is supposedly smart and superior to other philosophers because she is a great-and-talented ubermensch. One of the reasons why so many people grow out of the Rand phase is that they learn what logical fallacies and proper citations are when they get to college, and thus are able to identify them in her arguments. She needs the term &quot;philosopher&quot; to trick undereducated young minds, otherwise she's just another untalented pulp romance novelist. By pushing this, we are feeding the cult like we would if we called dianetics an alternative to psychiatry, or intelligent design as science. Wikipedia, as usual, is being dishonest with this article and only further justifying the accusation of &quot;obsessed Ayn Rand fan&quot; that the media has given to Jimbo.
:::Secondly, philosophy should use logic. Randism is built on strawmen, one of the most basic of logical fallacies. You can say greed is good because some guy that some guy probably likes is wrong about something he probably said, but there's nothing there that makes enough sense to call it philosophy. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 02:44, 9 September 2006 (UTC)
::::I'd like to point out that the first sentence of the post above is a straw-man argument, and that much of the rest amounts to a giant ad hominem.  Neither me, nor most Rand fans I know, believe she's some kind of ubermensch or special breed of human being, and we certainly aren't undereducated.[[User:Kdogg36|kdogg36]] 22:29, 28 September 2006 (UTC)
::::So, because you deem a philosopher's arguments to be &quot;bad&quot;, they're not a philosopher anymore?  But wait -- Rand thought that about mainstream philosophers!  What to do!
::::Btw, most of the &quot;good&quot; philosophers, if you didn't know this already, made at one point or another truly apalling arguments.  Nevertheless, they tend to be judged by their best works, not their worst.  Something to consider.
::::Rand is referenced as a philosopher because that characterization is ''true''.  If that fails to optimally quash her ideas, that's just too bad.  Even ''having'' Rand on Wikipedia expands her audience and makes people likely to believe her &quot;deception&quot;.  That's not a reason to leave her out.

:::::It's not about bad or good philosophy; it's a matter of is or isn't. Philosophy should be built on logic; Randism is not.
:::::I said &quot;logical fallacies&quot;, not &quot;appalling mistakes&quot;. Big difference. And I have yet to hear of a philosopher who's whole philosophy was built on a strawman and contained such a bad citation; even if they only made the former mistake, they'd be rejected by anyone with a decent education.
:::::Please argue against my statements, not what you'd prefer to argue against. A strawman from you will not make Rand's strawman any more philosophic. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 19:39, 9 September 2006 (UTC)

::::::If you want to be taken seriously, LGagnon, you should probably drop the ad hominems yourself (&quot;...rejected by anyone wiht a decent education.&quot;)  You can't expect people to argue reasonably with you if you announce up front that you believe they're obviously stupid just for disagreeing with you.  Your approach guarantees that no reasonable, logical people will engage you in debate, because you declare in advance that it would be a waste of their time.

:::::::A decent education should include basic logic. I know high school doesn't teach it, but a good college (the place where philosophy is usually taught) should include it in one of its required writing courses.
:::::::And I didn't mean to insult anyone here; those comments were directed at Rand herself. It's not an insult that she's poorly educated for a supposed philosopher, it's a fact; she really didn't come off as someone who knew what she was talking about (where's the direct arguments against Kant?), and she really didn't understand a simple concept of logic. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 13:03, 29 September 2006 (UTC)

I think my problem with this line of thought is that you could say the same things about almost all &quot;Continental&quot; philosophers; the only real difference is that they have canon status and she doesn't. I don't think you appreciate just how bad a lot of &quot;respectable&quot; figures are. So what do we do with that? Does the label simply come with canonization? I still feel like you're using a descriptive label as a value judgment, as when a traditionalist says &quot;Andy Warhol isn't really art.&quot; I don't have a problem with &quot;most academics do not regard her as a real philosopher&quot; properly cited, but something else is going on in this discussion, methinks. Why can't we just say (in the spirit of eschewing original research) that some say she is and some say she isn't? I mean, doesn't your appealing to your own classification intuitions also involve &quot;original research&quot;? [[User:Agent Cooper|Agent Cooper]] 02:12, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

:Actually, we had a source not long ago making the same exact argument I'm making now. Unfortunately, it was deleted and/or lost, and I am not assuming good faith on this. We've lost too many sources to rabid pro-Rand deletion, and this is another one. I keep on hearing this Orwellian argument that no source has been presented because none are still here, yet in truth nobody remembers them and someone is removing them. Until we get an admin to come here and mediate this so it doesn't fall to mob rule, there's no way anything can be done to improve this article. -- [[User talk:LGagnon|LGagnon]] 12:40, 10 September 2006 (UTC)

== Galt Motor Really a Perpetual Motion Machine? ==

Having just read &lt;i&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/i&gt;, I believe this section on &quot;Fictional technology&quot; about Galt's Motor ([[Atlas_shrugged#Galt.27s_Motor]]) is incorrect:

&quot;This motor generates energy from static electricity; since it is designed to provide its own power as long as it is activated, it is a type of perpetual motion machine.&quot;

I disagree. The notion was that the motor took static electricity out of the air.  This makes Galt's motor as much a perpetual motion machine as one driven by a solar panel, or, perhaps more clearly, a motor that ran using lightning as a source of energy.  Although I doubt the principle described has any physical reality, the notion was not that it created power out of nothing the way a perpetual motion machine would.

Before I remove the part about the perpetual motion, does anybody see something I'm missing?

Whoops... I forgot to sign this.  The above was at around 22:33, 20 October 2006 (UTC).  I have not made myself an account yet, but I will.
::I actually was thinking about this earlier today (for some reason), and I agree: While there is no scientific basis in the real world for the possibility of drawing energy that way, the Galt Motor does not provide its own energy, and so can't count as a PPM. [[User:MrVoluntarist|MrVoluntarist]] 20:53, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

While we are editing this subsection, I think the following sentence is also incorrect:

  &quot;Galt shows Dagny the motor and describes it in Part 3, Chapter 1.&quot;

I assume that this is referring to the part that starts at the bottom of page 669. Galt never actually shows Dagny the motor here. Galt shows her the building where it is housed, but he does not allow Dagny in because she is still a scab.  There is the whole discussion about how the door will only let somebody who speaks Galt's oath pass, and Dagny does not speak the oath.  Galt never describes the motor.  In Part 3, Chapter 2, we find out Galt is giving lectures on physics (starting on page 709), and it seems clear that the physics of the motor is one of the topics, but neither Dagny nor the reader get to hear any of these lectures.  This is too much detail for an encyclopedia article, though.  The motor is mentioned; we explain what it is and where Dagny first finds it. I think it makes sense to get in the fact that a working version eventually shows up. I could change this part to read something like:

  &quot;In Part 3, Chapter 1, Dagny learns that Galt is using a working version of the motor to generate electricity for Atlantis.&quot;

Perhaps somebody else has a better way to phrase it?  It is a bit awkward to just throw Atlantis in at the end like that, but it is not so bad.  After all, the section referred to is called &quot;Atlantis.&quot; [[User:207.171.180.101|207.171.180.101]] 22:09, 21 October 2006 (UTC)

== Rand's Theory of Sex ==

Shouldn't some mention be made of the emphasis she still does put on physical beauty?  The section currently makes it sound like the only thing that makes a person sexual are the values one may share with another.  Rand very clearly sees sexual attraction and the sexual act as more that just a response to shared values.  She spends much detail describing the attractiveness of her main characters.  They're always beautiful people (this is the case also in Anthem and in the Fountainhead) and her ideal sexual ethic celebrates that beauty in ''conjunction'' with the beauty of what she considers to be pure beliefs.  The immaterial and material are thus unseparated.  [[User:TyDeaton|TyDeaton]] 04:14, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

:I am not sure I agree, but I have read only &lt;i&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/i&gt;, so my larger context on Ayn Rand is going to be weak.  It seems to me that while the characters are described as physically attractive in both books, the description tends to center on either what the person was feeling or what they were doing.  For example, my impression was that Dagny was probably not particularly beautiful by purely physical standards (though I did not feel she was supposed to be ugly either.)  She is certainly not thought by Rearden's wife to be particularly attractive.  We usually see Dagny through the eyes of people who admire her, and she often appears beautiful in situations that one would not be.  For example, the chain of Rearden metal is flattering on her wrist.  She looks beautiful when she is disheveled and passed out from working all night.  Alternatively, we are shown how beautiful she is in her happiness at the completion of the John Galt line, a place where we would expect her to look her best, but the ephasis is on her joy.  Thinking of Galt, Galt's face is &quot;a face without guilt,&quot; which does not seem to imply he would necessarily be handsome otherwise.  On the flip side, Rearden's wife is downright ugly when she hooks up with Jim Taggart, even though it seems clear to me that she is a physically beautiful woman.

:Rand focuses a lot on the emotions that are revealed by appearance.  The bad guys all have faces that project fear and guilt.  I see beauty as more metaphorical than literal in the same way that characters with bad teeth are often corrupt.  There is usually no real connect implied between corruption and bad teeth; it's just a literary device.  That's my feeling anyway.

== More Problems with the Technology Section ==

The [[Atlas_Shrugged#Fictional_technology|technology section]] refers to &quot;a nerve-induction torture machine.&quot;  The device described in the book does not use nerve induction; it uses plain old electricity.  When I think of [[Nerve_induction]], I think of the pain box used in [[Dune (film)]].  (See also [[Gom_Jabbar]].)  Nerve induction implies that the device stimulates the nerves without actually injuring the person.  It is made very clear in &lt;i&gt;Atlas Shrugged&lt;/i&gt; that one of the technical innovations of the Ferris persuader is that it carefully applied enough voltage to hurt you, but dials it back before it injures you.  This makes it a fairly standard electric shock torture device much like we have today with some automated features.  I have never heard of contemporary electric shock torture being referred to as nerve induction before.  I think it is good to mention the device as I think that it is important to the theme of the book.  I am not sure of the best phrasing.  Perhaps &quot;a sophisticated electrical torture device&quot; would be better.  I'll leave this talk here for a little while to see if anybody wants to comment.
