== Misleading... ==

&quot;The working title throughout her writing was The Strike. According to Barbara Branden, the change was made for dramatic reasons––Rand believed that titling the novel 'The Strike' would have revealed the mystery element of the novel prematurely.&quot;

She did this with all of her novels, giving them titles that would help remind her what the central theme was, but then changing the titles to something that would not be understood by the reader until after the novel had been read. This is explained in Anthem Centennial Edition with Introduction by Ayn Rand (ISBN-10: 0452286352 ISBN-13: 978-0452286351), at least.

The above sentence makes it appear it is a quality of the book, while it should emphasize it was really a quality of the author's style.

For example:
Airtight became We The Living
Ego became Anthem
Second Hand Lives became The Fountainhead

== South Park citation ==

In the episode &quot;Chickenlover&quot;, number 3 of season 2 of the South Park cartoon, the book is stated to be boring and to steal from readers the will to read books in general. This is the opinion of an almost an-alphabet police officer though, so maybe the authors of South Park intended this opinion to be stupid.

== literary critic, Paul Krugman? ==

of all the Atlas critique, is an economist the best source, perhaps would could find a literary critic instead? Krugman didnt even write the snipe, instead copied the &quot;classic quote&quot; from a blog posted 3 years ago, and is described in the wikipedia article as &quot;oft-quoted&quot; which is at best wp:OR as few quote unknown bloggers like John Rogers. Krugman does not seem to understand the book, http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/06/john-galt-wants-price-support/, which is actually referring &quot;interest rates&quot; as the &quot;price&quot; that wants supporting. some may defend this as sarcasm, yet John Galt refereed to people using government to profit as looters, a point lost on Krugman.

:great :).  in the meantime, would you agree we can at least remove the Krugman part and attribute the Fantasy novel comparison to it's actual author, himself notable chiefly as a failure for winning the 2004 worst screenplay award? certainly criticism from such a source is ill-thought when so many other notable critics have opinions on this novel, i look forward to seeing your improvements to this section.

:::glad you posted the text, i will run thru the current errors:

:::*''Acclaim has not been unanimous'', '''Wikipedia:Attribution.''' the paragraph is referring to a quip is by John Rogers, not Krugman. Krugman has no comment about the novel, rather states the following about the author which would be a different article: ''best line I’ve ever heard about '''[[Ayn Rand]]’s''' influence''.
:::::linking the NYT/Krugman as the source of the quip/line is incorrect, the actual source is '''a 250 word blog post reviewing the films [[Better Off Ted]] , TV shows like [[Lost]], services like [[Dropbox]],'''

:::*'''POV''', a disparaging quip/line from a blog about martial arts and monkeys is not WP material. i seriously doubt this would be considered a RS on any topic in WP and suspect the material was originally '''added only to malign the book without offering any useful critique''' of the work. when so many notable errors exist within Atlas Shrugged, how could one possibly offer this tripe in exchange?

Thank you for your opinion - the [[Paul Krugman]] edit above, referring to several [[WP:NOTABLE|WP:NOTABLES]] (ie, [[Paul Krugman]] and [[ John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]]) in a [[WP:RELIABLESOURCE]] (ie, [[New York Times]]), seems *entirely* ok - additionally, the edit may help balance the [[Atlas Shrugged#Praise.2C_criticism.2C_influence.2C_and_renewed_popularity|Praise and Criticism section]] of the [[Atlas Shrugged]] article - which, at the moment, seems to be slanted more toward Praise than not(?) (Wikipedia strives to be [[WP:NEUTRAL]] - and not a [[WP:SOAPBOX]]) (to better balance this section, other edits, critical of the novel including those from worthy literary sources, are welcome of course) - several related points:
* [[Paul Krugman]] refers to the [[John Rogers (writer)|John Rogers]] quote *because* this quote represents Krugman's view of the novel (&quot;best line I've ever heard about Ayn Rand's influence,&quot; according to Krugman) - this seems *entirely* ok - and appropriately attributed to me.

Atlas Shrugged is a book purporting to make economic claims, which [[Paul Krugman]] is certainly qualified to evaluate. I agree though that a literary take would be a good inclusion. A few years ago I tried to incorporate the thoughts of science fiction author [[John Scalzi]], who liked the work but with the caveat that you can basically make any claim with fiction. I was not successful. The challenge was that Scalzi used vulgar language in his blog for the purposes of humor: when I quoted him in the wiki piece it was jarring. It's probably worth another try. Scalzi makes some economic claims in his piece, so I'll link to him via Professor Bradford DeLong's endorsement: http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/10/malevolent-intelligent-cups-of-yoghurt-menace-humanity.html The point is not whether Atlas Shrugged is good, bad, silly or serious: rather it is to present a range of common reactions to this culturally significant work.

1. I'll note that the quote itself contains the name &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, so technically Krugman does mention the book, albeit through someone else.&lt;br&gt;
2. Moving to other issues, here's a citation for &quot;Oft quoted&quot; quip: Paul Krugman (again!): &quot;As a widely quoted internet meme says, the unrealistic fantasy world portrayed in one of those books can warp a young man's character forever; the other book is about orcs.&quot;  http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/04/paul-krugman-asimov-economics (I see he softened the language for an English family newspaper!) Second citation, from a 2011 book by Gary Hayden: http://books.google.com/books?id=URA-BX0oIRwC&amp;pg=PA25-IA3&amp;dq=two+bookish++atlas+shrugged+and+lord+of+the+rings&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KUxCUon7MYfc2QX42YCwAQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=two%20bookish%20%20atlas%20shrugged%20and%20lord%20of%20the%20rings&amp;f=false &lt;br&gt;
3. So &quot;oft quoted&quot; is factual and cited by two third parties. But does it add to the article? I included it years back because I wanted to emphasize that Krugman was not the originator of the quote. Now the alleged John Rogers author has been tracked down and placed in article. So: what are the advantages and disadvantages of keeping those two words? Maybe a better wordsmith than myself could help out.&lt;br&gt;
4. I'm pretty sure John Rogers wasn't the first to make that joke: older version date to the 1980s. But I have no citation for that and maybe I'm misremembering. I'm just mentioning this because there's a decent chance of a later edit on this topic.&lt;br&gt;
5. Whew! Thanks for the feedback. [[User:Measure for Measure|Measure for Measure]] ([[User talk:Measure for Measure|talk]]) 02:46, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
:i find it fitting that the best critic found for this book is noted only for his recognition as the worst in his field.

== &quot;100 best novels of the 20th century&quot; blurb should be removed [uncredible source]. ==

The source being used is an Internet poll: http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-novels/

Which is highly sensitive to 'blitz voting', which is also why non-professional reviews on Metacritic are rarely used, and even looking at that list 4 out of the top 10 are Rand books, and 3 out of the top 10 are Hubbard's, showing a very high Libertarian slant. It's not nearly as subject-varied as the professional list on that same page (which doesn't include the book in its top 100). &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/184.69.69.30|184.69.69.30]] ([[User talk:184.69.69.30|talk]]) 20:21, 23 September 2013‎ (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned IP --&gt;

== Sourcing ==

I've just tagged a few paragraphs for sourcing issues but could tag many more. For example, we say that John Galt expresses Rand's personal opinion but we don't seem to have any verification of that: he is just a character in a novel. Novelists create many characters, some traits of which may reflect the writer's own opinion while other traits may not; or none may be a reflection; or (in rare cases) all may be a reflection. We cannot interpret primary sources, such as the book itself, because that constitutes [[WP:OR|original research]]. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 11:35, 22 October 2013 (UTC)
:I've just tagged the entire &quot;Theory of sex&quot; section as OR. The rationale should be obvious. - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 17:46, 22 October 2013 (UTC)
::Rand refers to and quotes from Galt's speech in her philosophical essays, confirming that his words reflected her views. There's not interpretation required, so no possibility of original research. [[User:MilesMoney|MilesMoney]] ([[User talk:MilesMoney|talk]]) 05:58, 23 October 2013 (UTC)

== Reason magazine ==

We currently say &quot;... the title of the libertarian magazine, ''Reason: Free Minds, Free Markets'', is taken directly from John Galt ...&quot;. That is unsourced, although a quote from Galt is present. What concerns me more is that a look at [[Reason (magazine)]] and in particular at the image shown in the infobox there suggests that ''Free Minds, Free Markets'' is a strapline, not a title. The article title itself seems to bear that out, so perhaps this sentence needs to be tweaked as well as sourced? - [[User:Sitush|Sitush]] ([[User talk:Sitush|talk]]) 17:03, 22 October 2013 (UTC)
:Based on http://cloudfront-assets.reason.com/assets/db/1350587890858.pdf, it's a strapline, albeit one that's used consistently and prominently. It's also found in it's self-description at http://reason.com/about. I don't believe there's any doubt that Rand is the source of the quote.
